# Overview

We already learned that everything in R that exists is an *object*.
You most likely noted that there are different types of objects:
`2`, for instance, was a number, but `assign` was a function.^[In fact, 
we will learn below that `2` is not really a number, but a vector
or length 1. Only in a next step, `2` counts as a 'number', or, more precisely
as a 'double'.]
As you might have guessed, there are many more types of objects. 
To understand the fundamental object types in R is an essential prerequisite
to master more complicated programming challenges than those we have encountered
so far. Thus, this post is among those that will introduce you to the most 
important object types that you will encounter in R. 

These data types are summarized in the following figure:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("vector-classification.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

This post will be about the most common types of vectors.
See the [previous post](/tutorial/object-types-func/) 
for a treatment of functions, and the 
[upcoming one](/tutorial/object-types-adv/) 
for more advanced types of vectors, such as `factor`, `matrix`, and `data.frame`.

# Vectors

Vectors are the most important object type in `R` - almost all data that we will
work with in `R` are vectors of some sort. Within the class of vectors, the most
important distinction is that between **atomic vectors** and **lists**, which
are sometimes also called *generic vectors*.^[The only object type that is
of relevance to us aside these two is `NULL`. We will learn about it during
the end of this post.]
Both atomic vectors and lists consist of one or more other objects. What 
distinguishes the two is that while
*atomic vectors are composed only of objects of the same type*, lists can 
comprise objects of different types.

## Atomic vectors

This makes it easy to classify atomic vectors in more detail: we usually say 
that the type of atomic vector is the type of the object it encompasses.
Four major types of atomic vectors in this sense exist:

* `logical` (logical values): there are only two relevant logical values: 
`TRUE` und `FALSE`^[While you can abbreviate the two with `T` and `F`, respectively,
I recommend against using these sometimes ambiguous abbreviations.]
* `integer` (whole numbers): this type should be self-explanatory. Less 
intuitive is the rule that in order to define an integer in `R` you need to type
the number followed by the letter `L` such that `R` interprets the number 
as an integer.^[This syntax has historical reasons: when the type `integer`
was introduced in `R`, the developers were guided by the type `long integer` of
the programming language `C`. In `C` the suffix for such an integer was 'l' or
'L'. The R developers just transferred this practice into `R`, only they 
did not use 'i' to avoid a possible confusion between 'l' and 'i', which look
very similar in many fonts (the suffix 'i' in `R` is used for the imaginary
component of complex numbers).] Examples are `1L`, `-400L` or `10L`.  
* `double` (decimal numbers): these should be self-explanatory as well. 
Examples are `1.5`, `0.0`, or `-500.32`.
* Whole and decimal numbers are often summarized in the category `numeric`.
However, the use of `numeric` is almost always confusing, and many functions 
show counter-intuitive behavior when this category is used. I recommend you to 
never use it.
* `character` (words): these can contain all kinds of tokens and are characterized
by the fact that they always start and end with `"` (or `'`). Examples would be
`"Hello"`, `"500"` or `"1_2_Three"`.

As indicated above, an atomic vector only comprises elements of the same type.
In this context, we should mention, however, the at first sight 'strange' 
data type `NA`, which denotes a missing value:^[In principle there are different 
kinds of missing values, such as `NA_integer_` or `NA_character_`, but they are
irrelevant in practice: any `NA` value in an atomic vector automatically 
'mimics' the type of the atomic vector.]
whenever an element of a vector is missing, e.g. when the vector is used to 
store observations of subjects that have participated in an experiment, and 
for some subjects the observation is 
missing, we will use `NA`.^[`NULL` on the other hand, is used to represent an 
absent vector, not an absent element of a vector. We will come back to `NULL` 
during the end of the post.]

### Testing and coercing types 

In the following we will study the different types of atomic vectors and their
typical behavior in more detail. But before doing so we should introduce the 
function `typeof()`: it helps us to identify the type of an object in the first 
place. To see how, lets call the function with the object (or the name of the
object) we are interested about:

```{r}
typeof(2L)
```
```{r}
x <- 22.0
typeof(x)
```

There is also a family of functions that allows us to test whether an object
is actual of a certain type or not. The general syntax here is `is.*()`. 
For instance:

```{r}
x <- 1.0
is.integer(x)
```
```{r}
is.double(x)
```

This function always returns an object of type `logical`:

```{r}
y <- is.double(x)
typeof(y)
```

We can also try to transform objects from one type into another. 
We call this process 'coercion' an the general syntax is `as.*()*`.
For instance:

```{r}
x <- "2"
print(
  typeof(x)
)
x <- as.double(x)
print(
  typeof(x)
)
```

Such a transformation is, however, not always possible:

```{r}
as.double("Hello")
```

Since `R` does not know how to turn the word 'Hello' into a decimal number, 
it transforms it into a 'missing value' - `NA`.

For the basic types discussed above there is a logical hierarchy of feasible
transformations:
`logical` &rarr; `integer` &rarr; `double` &rarr; `character`,
meaning that you can always transform a decimal number into a word, but not
vice versa.

> **Transgression: Why change the types of objects anyway?**
> Data types are extremely important for a programming language because 
otherwise it would remain unclear how mathematical operations could be 
applied to different objects such as numbers or words.
You will transform objects yourself especially when you want to use a certain 
operation that is only defined for a certain type of object, and the object
you are dealing with has been stored as a different type.
This can happen, for example, when you read in data or translate words into 
numerical values yourself.
If unexpected errors occur in your code with cryptic error messages, it is
always a good idea to check the types of the objects used and transform them 
if necessary.

```{r}
x <- 2
y <- as.character(x)
print(y)
z <- as.double(y) # This works
print(z)
k <- as.double("Hallo") # This does not work
print(k)
```

When transforming logical values, `TRUE` counts as `1` and `FALSE` as `0`, 
a fact that will come in handy later on:

```{r}
x <- TRUE
as.integer(x)
```

```{r}
y <- FALSE
as.integer(y)
```

Since it is not always clear when `R` issues a warning for transformations
that are incompatible with the hierarchy just introduced and when it does not, 
you should always be cautious!

Moreover, transformations might change the properties of the transformed objects
implicitly in unexpected ways. 
For instance, a transformation from a decimal number to a whole number can lead
to unexpected rounding behavior:

```{r}
x <- 1.99
as.integer(x)
```

Another example is the following:

```{r}
z <- as.logical(99)
print(z)
```

Such implicit changes of the object properties do not necessary come with a 
warning message, so one should always be careful when transforming objects!

In many cases, functions do the necessary transformations of their arguments
automatically. In most cases this is very practical:

```{r}
x <- 1L # Integer
y <- 2.0 # Double
z <- x + y
typeof(z)
```

But it can be dangerous in some cases as well.

When adding up logical values they are transformed to numbers:

```{r}
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE
z <- x + y # TRUE counts as 1, FALSE as 0
print(z) 
```

This is useful if you want to know, for instance, how many elements of a vector
meet a certain logical criterion:

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
sum(x > 3)
```

In all these cases it is very important to stay informed about the types of 
objects you are dealing with. To help you out, the following table contains 
an overview over the most important transformation and test functions:

Type      | Test           | Transformation |
----------+----------------+----------------|
logical   | `is.logical`   | `as.logical`   |
double    | `is.double`    | `as.double`    |
integer   | `is.integer`   | `as.integer`   |
character | `is.character` | `as.character` |
function  | `is.function`  | `as.function`  |
NA        | `is.na`        | NA             |
NULL      | `is.null`      | `as.null`      |

A final remark on **scalars**:
with scalar we usually refer to 'single numbers', such as `2`.
There is no such concept in R: `2` is a vector with one element 
(or: of length 1).
Thus, we do not distinguish the type of a vector with or more than one
elements.


**Note:** As you might have guessed already, we use the function `c()` to 
create longer vectors:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
x
```

We can also use this function to concatenate vectors:

```{r}
x <- 1:3 # Shortcut for: x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- 4:6
z <- c(x, y)
z
```

Since atomic vectors can only contain objects of the same type, one might expect
the following code, which tries to concatenate objects of different types, to
produce an error:

```{r}
x <- c(1, "Hallo")
```

But this is not what happens! R transforms the objects according to the 
hierarchy discussed above:  
`logical` &rarr; `integer` &rarr; `double` &rarr; `character`. 
Due to the absence of errors or warning messages, such operations are a
regular source for mistakes.

**Note:** The length of a vector corresponds to its numbers of elements. We
can 'measure' its length using the function `length()`:

```{r}
x =  c(1, 2, 3)
len_x <- length(x)
len_x
```

> **Transgression: How large can an integer become?**
In R, objects of type `integer` are stored as 32-bit files.
This means that for each single `integer`, 32 bits of storage are available on
your computer. This implies that really large numbers cannot be stored as 
integers, simply because the 32 bits are not sufficient: 

```{r}
x <- 2147483647L
typeof(x)
```

```{r, warning=TRUE, message=TRUE}
y <- 2147483648L
typeof(y)
```

> As you can see, the largest number that we can store as 32-bit integer is
2147483647. Larger numbers must be stored as `double`. The drawback of saving
numbers in this type is, however, the risk of a loss of precision. If you 
want to avoid this you could try to save an integer as a 64 bit integer.
This possibility has been added to R later to save large numbers as integers
(something that happens faster than you think).
To do so we must use the package^[If you are not sure what a package is, 
recap the last chapter of the post on [first steps in R](/tutorial/first-steps/).]
`bit64`:

```{r, warning=TRUE}
z <- bit64::as.integer64(2147483648)
bit64::is.integer64(z)
```

> Because this is a data type that has been added to `R` later, several functions
do not work with 64-bit integers if the package `bit64` is not installed. 
Moreover, several standard functions return very irritating outputs:

```{r}
typeof(z)
```

> For this reason, and because `bit64` is not part of the standard installation
of `R`, you should avoid storing large numbers as `integer64` whenever possible.
Very large numbers should be stored as `double` or, when precision is a serious
issue, you should scale them down and then save them as `integer`.

### Logical operations

The logical values `TRUE` and `FALSE` are often the result of logical 
operations, such as 'Is 2 larger than 1?'.
Such logical operations occur very frequently and its a good idea to familiarize
yourself with the logical operators. You can find an overview in the following
table:

| Operator | Function in R | Example  |
|:--------:|:-------------:|:---------|
| larger | `>` | `2>1` |
| smaller | `<` | `2<4` |
| equal   | `==` | `4==3` |
| larger or equal | `>=` | `8>=8` |
| smaller or equal | `<=` | `5<=9` |
| not equal | `!=` | `4!=5` |
| and | `&` | `x<90 & x>55` |
| or | `|` | `x<90 | x>55` |
| either or | `xor()` | `xor(2<1, 2>1)` |
| not | `!` | `!(x==2)` |
| is true | `isTRUE()` | `isTRUE(1>2)` |

The result of such logical operations is always a logical value:

```{r}
x <- 4
y <- x == 8
typeof(y)
```

You may also test longer vectors:

```{r}
x <- 1:3
x<2
```

Tests can also be chained:

```{r}
x <- 1L
x>2 | x<2 & (is.double(x) & x!=0)
```

Since many mathematical operations interpret `TRUE` as `1`, it is easy to 
check how often a certain condition is met:

```{r}
x <- 1:50 
smaller_20 <- x<20 
print(
  sum(smaller_20) # How many elements are smaller then 20?
  )
print(
  sum(smaller_20/length(x)) # Whats the share of these elements?
)
```

### Vectorization

The chained operation we just saw is an example for *vectorizing* an operation.
This means that the same operation is applied to many elements, all of which
are concatenated as a vector. For instance, if you want to compute the
square root of the numbers 5, 6 and 7 you could do:

```{r}
sqrt(5)
sqrt(6)
sqrt(7)
```

Or you vectorize the operation:

```{r}
sqrt(c(5,6,7))
```

Vectorizing operations is very useful since it speeds up the computations 
considerably. Vectorized operations are *far* more efficient and faster
than applying the operation to each element of the vector separately. Thus,
whenever you need to apply a certain operation more than once you should always
think about using vectorization.^[We learn more about this later in the course
when delving into the topic of *iteration*.]

### More on words

Words are distinguished by the fact that their beginning and their end gets 
indicated by the symbol `'` or `"`:

```{r}
x <- "Hello"
typeof(x)
```
```{r}
y <- 'Bye!'
typeof(y)
```

Just as other kinds of atomic vectors, they can by concatenated using `c()`:

```{r}
z <- c(x, "und", y)
z
```

A useful function in this context is `paste()`, which transforms and combines
elements of several vectors: 

```{r}
x <- 1:10
y <- paste("Try nb.", x)
y
```

The function `paste()` also accepts an optional argument `sep`, which allows
us to specify a token that should be placed between the elements to be 
combined (the default is `sep=" "`): 

```{r}
day_nr <- 1:10
x_axis <- paste("Day", day_nr, sep = ": ")
x_axis
```


> *Note**: Here we have an example of what is called 'recycling'. 
since the vector `c("Day")` was shorter than the vector `day_nr`, `c("Day")` 
is simply copied so that the operation with `paste()` makes sense.
Recycling is useful, but sometimes it can be harmful, namely when you think 
that you are using two vectors of the same length, but this is actually not
the case. In such a case recycling leads to the fact that 
no error message is printed and the fact that the two vectors are not of the
same length remains unnoticed An example of this is the following code, in which
the intention is clearly to connect all weekdays to numbers and one weekday was
simply forgotten:

```{r}
days <- paste("Tag ", 1:7, ":", sep="")
day_names <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")
paste(days, day_names)
```

### Missing values and NULL

As indicated above, missing values are encoded as `NA`. This is particularly 
useful in statistical contexts, where are particular element of a vector cannot
simply be removed if it is unavailable.

> **Example:** The vector `x` contains a logical value that indicates whether a
person has correctly answered the question on a questionnaire. If the person
did not answer the third question on the questionnaire, this should be indicated 
by `NA`. Simply omitting the value makes it impossible to determine afterwards 
*which* question the person did not answer.

Most operations that get `NA` as an input will also give `NA` as an output, 
because it is unclear what the result of the operation would be for different 
values for for the missing value:

```{r}
5 + NA
```

The only exception is an operation that yields a certain value completely 
independent from what you would substitute for `NA`:

```{r}
NA | TRUE # Always TRUE, no matter what you substitute for NA
```

To test whether a vector `x` contains missing values you should always use the 
function `is.na`, never `x==NA`:

```{r}
x <- c(NA, 5, NA, 10)
print(x == NA) # Unclear since not clear whether all NA must stand for the same value

print(
  is.na(x)
)
```

Whenever an operation yields a value that cannot be defined, the result is
not `NA` but `NaN` (*not a number*):

```{r}
0 / 0
```

Another special element is `NULL`. 
`NULL` is in fact a data type in itself (i.e. it is not a vector), 
but in practice its best thought of as a vector of length zero:

```{r}
x <- NULL
length(x)
```

`NULL` is frequently used to indicate that something does not exist.
An empty vector, for instance, is `NULL`:

```{r}
x <- c()
x
length(x)
```

This is different to a vector with one (or more) missing *elements*:

```{r}
y <- NA
length(y)
```

When you define your own functions, you might use `NULL` as the default value
for optional arguments. We will learn about such more advanced strategies 
later in this course. For now, its best to think of `NULL` as an vector 
of length zero. 

### Indexing and replacement

We can extract single elements of a vector using squared brackets:

```{r}
x <- c(2,4,6)
x[1]
```

This also allows us to modify specific elements:

```{r}
x <- c(2,4,6)
x[2] <- 99
x
```

But we can also extract more than one element:

```{r}
x[1:2]
```

Negative indices eliminate the respective elements:

```{r}
x[-1]
```

To get the last element of a vector you might combine this idea with the 
function `length()`:

```{r}
x[length(x)]
```


### Useful functions when working with atomic vectors

Here we shall mention a few functions that are particularly useful in the context of 
atomic vectors,^[For many common tasks there is already a predefined function in
R. The easiest way to find them is by googling] 
especially when it comes to producing such vectors 
or to perform arithmetic operations with them.

**Creating atomic vectors**:

A sequence of whole numbers is something that we use very frequently.
To create such sequences, the shortcut `:` comes in handy:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
```{r}
y <- 10:1
y
```

To build more complex sequences we can use `seq()`, which in its simplest 
case is equivalent to `:`:

```{r}
x <- seq(1, 10)
print(x)
```

The function `seq()`, however, allows for a number of useful optional arguments.
For instance, `by` allows us to control the space between the numbers: 

```{r}
y <- seq(1, 10, by = 0.5)
print(y)
```

If we want to specify the desired length of the resulting vector and let 
`R` choose the necessary space between the elements, we may use `length.out`:

```{r}
z <- seq(2, 8, length.out = 4)
print(z)
```

And if we want to create a vector with the length as another vector,
the argument `along.with` comes in handy. This is often used for creating
index vectors.^[An index vector `x` to any vector
`y` with `N` elements contains the integers from 1 to `N`. The *n*th value
of x thus corresponds to the index of the *n*th value of `y`.]
In such a case we do not have to specify the index numbers
directly:

```{r}
z_index <- seq(along.with = z)
print(z_index)
```

Another common task is to repeat a certain vector. This can be done with `rep()`:

```{r}
x <- rep(NA, 5)
print(x)
```


**Operations**

There are a number of operations that we use very frequently together with vectors.
Often we are interested in the **length** of a vector. 
For this we can use the function `length()`:

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
length(x)
```

If we are looking for the **largest** and **smallest** value of a vector we can
use `min()` and `max()`:

```{r}
min(x)
```

```{r}
max(x)
```

Both functions (and many more similar functions) have the optional argument
`na.rm`, which can be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 
In the case of `TRUE`, all `NA` values are removed before the operation
gets applied: 

```{r}
y <- c(1,2,3,4,NA)
min(y)
```
```{r}
min(y, na.rm = TRUE)
```


The **mean** or the **variance/standard deviation** of the elements can be 
computed with `mean()`, `var()`, and `sd()`, all of which have also the
optional argument`na.rm`:

```{r}
mean(x)
```
```{r}
var(y)
```
```{r}
var(y, na.rm = T)
```

Finally, we often want to compute the **sum** or the **product** of all 
the elements of the vector. Here the functions `sum()` and `prod()` are useful:

```{r}
sum(x)
```

```{r}
prod(y, na.rm = T)
```


## Lists

In contrast to atomic vectors, lists can contain objects of different types.
We create lists via the function `list()`:

```{r}
l_1 <- list(
  "a",
  c(1,2,3),
  FALSE
)
typeof(l_1)
```

```{r}
l_1
```

Lists can become very complex. The function `str()` (short for "structure") 
helps us to get a quick overview over a list and its elements:

```{r}
str(l_1)
```

We can name the elements of lists:^[We can actually also do this with 
vectors, but it is more common in the context of lists.]

```{r}
l_2 <- list(
  "first_element" = "a",
  "second_element" = c(1,2,3),
  "third_element" = FALSE
)
```

We can retrieve the names of all elements of the list with `names()`:

```{r}
names(l_2)
```

There are two very important differences in the handling of vectors and lists:

1. Vectorization does not work for lists
2. Indexing works differently

The first issue can be illustrated easily:

```{r}
vec_expl <- c(1,2,3)
list_expl <- list(1,2,3)
sqrt(vec_expl)
```

But:
```{r, error=TRUE}
sqrt(list_expl)
```

The second issue is due to the more complex structure of lists. For vectors we
extracted single elements via `[`. For lists, there is a difference between
`[` and `[[`. The former always returns a list:

```{r}
l_1[2]
```

The second then returns a vector and is more similar to the behavior of `[` in
the context of atomic vectors:

```{r}
l_1[[2]]
```

To extract an element of this vector we can chain the brackets:

```{r}
l_1[[2]][3]
```

We can also extract elements by their name:

```{r}
l_2[[1]]
```
```{r}
l_2[["first_element"]]
```

Lists are fundamental to many more complex structures that we will encounter 
later. They are more flexible than atomic vectors, but this flexibility also
makes them more difficult to use and less efficient for tasks where this 
flexibility is not needed. As a rule of thumb, whenever you can represent 
something as an atomic vector, you should do so. You should always have a good
reason for using lists!
