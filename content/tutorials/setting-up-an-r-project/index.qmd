# Introduction

This post is about how you set up an adequate project environment.
By this I mean the folders you should create, and how you should save your
files. The structure introduced here will help you to keep your project 
structured and to keep an overview about your work, but also to 
make it easier to share your project with others.

In all, whenever you start a new programming project you should set up the 
infrastructure described below. Such project could be a term paper, a research
endeavor, or just the code to create some visualizations. Later you might find
that some aspects of the infrastructure below feel like a bit of an overkill,
especially for very small undertakings. But especially in the beginning its better
to be save than sorry and to set up the whole project as described below.

In all, setting up a good working environment includes the following steps:

1. Find a good place for the project on your computer.
2. Create a directory with an R project
3. Create the relevant sub-directories

Then you should always familiarize yourself with how to use the `here`-package 
with your project.

There are some additional steps one might to take, such as initiating a 
[Git repository](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)
or setting up a 
[renv environment](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)
. 
Moreover, for larger projects you might also want to add a `README.md`.
But for now the steps mentioned above are sufficient.
But before going through them one by one, we need to clarify two important 
technical concepts:

(1) the concept of a *working directory* and 
(2) the distinction between *absolute* and *relative* paths

# Preface: Working directory and paths

The [working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory) 
is a folder on the computer which R uses as an default anchor
for all file paths used to accesses input, such as data sets, or to store
output. 
The default working directory the user directory, but it can be changed.
We can display the current working directory using the `getwd()` function.
In my case the working directory looks like this:

```
/Users/graebnerc/Teaching/DataScience22/
```

Now assume we produced a plot in our current session and want to save it using 
the function `ggplot2::ggsave()`. You learn (or have learned) in the session
on [visualization](content/material/session06.qmd) that this function takes, 
among others, an argument `filename` that specifies the name of the file that is 
meant to contain the plot.
Now if I were to tell R to save the plot under the name `test.pdf` like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = "test.pdf")
```

R would save it in the following location:

```
/Users/graebnerc/Teaching/DataScience22/test.pdf
```

As you can see R uses the current working directory as an 'anchor', and
all paths provided are *relative* to this anchor. 
This means that, assuming that in our working directory exists a folder 
called `output`, we could save our file `test.pdf` in this folder by making
the following function call:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = "output/test.pdf")
```

Viewed upon from a global perspective the file is saved here:

```
/Users/graebnerc/Teaching/DataScience22/output/test.pdf
```

Since the path provided is *relative* to the working directory, we call paths 
such as those we would have passed to `ggsave()` above as **relative paths**.

Alternatively, we could also provide R directly with the *absolute path*.
In this case, we would need to type the complete path, starting from the 
[root directory](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stammverzeichnis) of the 
computer.
Rather then assuming the absolute path implicitly as above, we would need to 
do the following call:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave(
  filename = "/Users/graebnerc/Teaching/DataScience22/output/test.pdf"
  )
```

When we use absolute paths, we can save a file at any position on the computer
we want. For instance, we do the following

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave(
  filename = "/Users/graebnerc/GreatPlots/test.pdf"
  )
```

to save the file here:

```
/Users/graebnerc/GreatPlots/test.pdf
```

While it seems to be attractive to use absolute paths because of their expressive
power, i.e. the possibility to save files anywhere we want, I can only advice 
against using them. In fact, absolute paths are something that you *might* use
in your console when you want to save a file quickly during a private programming
session. But you should *never* use absolute paths in scripts.

A central argument in favor of relative paths is that code using relative paths
can function when executed on different computers. Absolute paths look different
on every computer, so they will always produce errors when being transferred across
computers. Have a look at the following path from above:

```
/Users/graebnerc/Teaching/DataScience22/output/test.pdf
```

I hope you agree that it is *highly unlikely* that a path involving my account
name exists on your computer. Thus, if I sent you a script that contains a 
reference to this path, it will produce an error once you execute it. Thus, we
will always use relative paths below.

Of course, one problem is that the 'anchor' from which the relative path will
be evaulated on my and your computer must somehow be harmonized. As we will 
learn below, this can be achieved through the use of R project files and the
package  [here](https://here.r-lib.org/).

# Step 1: Find a good place for the project on your computer

First of all you have to decide on a place on your computer in which
all data related to your project, i.e. data, scripts, images, 
etc., should be saved.
It is usually a good idea to avoid places such as the Desktop or your
Download folder.

# Step 2: Create an R-project

After having identified the right place for our project on our computer, we
will now create an R-project at exactly this place. To this place, open R-Studio,
and either click on `File/New Project`, or on the blue botton in the upper 
left part of the pane, directly to the right of the `New File` button. 
You should now see the 'New Project Wizard':

```{r newproj1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics(
  "new-proj-1.png", auto_pdf = T)
```

We click on `New Directory`^[We could also have created a folder in the
previous step and then chosen this folder here via `Existing directory`. This
is useful if you want to add an R project file to an already existing project, 
but the approach of creating a new directory is more general and should be
your default approach.] and then on `New Project`. Then we should see the 
following:

```{r newproj2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics(
  "new-proj-2.png", auto_pdf = T)
```

We first add the name of our project in the field `Directory name`.
The name should not contain any special characters or blanks, and should be
informative about the content of the project. I this example I have chosen the
title `DataScienceLecture`.
Below you choose the location for the project that you have determined in the
previous step. 
By clicking on `Create Project`, R-Studio creates a folder of the name of 
the project within in the directory you have chosen in step 1.
Within this folder, R-Studio automatically creates a file called
`NameOfYourProject.Rproj` (here: `DataScienceLecture.Rproj`).

From now on, whenever you want to work on this project you can just double click
on this project file to open R-studio and link it to this project automatically.
Alternatively, you can also open R Studio, and then open the project by 
choosing the `.Rproj` file via `File/Open Project...`.

You should always make sure that when you work on your project using R-Studio,
the current session is linked to this project. You can see the project your
current session is linked to in the upper right of the R-Studio pane:

```{r newproj3, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics(
  "new-proj-3.png", auto_pdf = T)
```

Linking your current session to a project comes with many advantages: not only
is your working directory automatically set to the project folder, you can also
access previous commands in a command history, and its easier to transfer the
project from one computer to another.

In the next step, you will now populate the newly created project directory
with folders.

# Step 3: Create the relevant sub-directories

A sensible directory structure helps (1) not to lose track of one's programming 
project, (2) to collaborate with others across computers, and 
(3) to use collaboration platforms such as Github and to conduct research 
that can be replicated and understood by others.

The following directory structure is an established recommendation. 
In some projects you may not need all the sub-directories suggested here, 
in others, it may be more appropriate to use more.
In any case, the structure below is usually an excellent starting point, and it
also the default one that I and many others use in most research projects.

Overall, the following folders should be created in your project directory:

* A subdirectory `data` in which you save all the data used in the project. 
Except for cases where you use very few different data sets, it is generally 
advisable to create two subfolders within `data`:
A subdirectory `raw` which contains the raw data as it was downloaded from the
internet or collected from an experiment.
This raw data should **never** be changed, otherwise your work will not be fully
replicable and irreparable damage may occur. 
All changes to the data should be documented by scripts
that take the raw data as input and generate a modified data set as output. 
This modified data set should then be stored in the subdirectory `tidy.`

> **Example:** You download data on GDP in Germany from Eurostat and data on
unemployment from AMECO. 
Both data sets should be saved in the subfolder `data/raw`, and they should
never be manipulated.
Rather, you may write a script `setup_data.R`, which you save in `R`, and which 
imports both datasets, transforms them and creates the combined dataset called
`macro_data.csv`. This is a [tidy](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) 
data set (you learn how to produce such data sets later in this course), 
which you can save in the directory `data/tidy`,
and that will be the vantage point for further analysis.
This will allow everyone to see how the data you have used has resulted from 
the raw data and your work remains completely reproducible and transparent. 

* A subdirectory `R`, which contains all R scripts, i.e. files ending with `.R`.

* A subdirectory `output`, in which you save all output produced by the scripts
from `R`, such as tables or plots. The content of this folder must be fully 
replicable using the content of the folders `R` and `data`. If you produce a 
lot of output, it might be useful to create additional subdirectories, such as
`tables` or `figures.`

* A subdirectory `text`, in which you save all written text, e.g. the report
you are writing, or your lecture notes.

* A subdirectory `misc` in which you stuff everything that does not fit into 
any of the other directories. Such a directory is important: you should not 
save any misceallenous files in the root directory. This will cause a lot of 
confusion. As a rule of thumb, the only files you should keen in your project
main directory is the `.Rproj` file and, if applicable a `LICENSE.md` containing
a license for your code, and a `README.md` file in which you explain the 
content and functioning of your project.

Assuming our project directory is called `DataScienceLecture`, the the default
directory structure would look like this:

```{r folder, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='50%', eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("wd-structure.png", auto_pdf = T)
```

Now that you have set up a sensible directory structure, the only thing you are
missing for woriless project work is the knowledge of how to use the 
`here`-package. This helps us to remedy the problem of finding a sensible anchor
for out relative paths, as discussed in the first section.

# Creating portable relative paths using the here-package

The [here](https://github.com/r-lib/here)-package allows you to create 
file paths in a way that those parts of your code that contain file paths
always work across different computers.

As described above, you should always use *relative* paths in everyday work.
In two situations, however, the use of relative paths can be problematic
(1) when collaborating with others, and (2) when using 
R Markdown.^[With R Markdown you can write texts directly in `R`.
This allows you to keep statistical analysis and the description of the results 
in one document.
This homepage, for example, was also written entirely in R Markdown.
You will learn how to use R-Markdown soon.].

Suppose, for instance, that Birte and Claudius are working together on an R 
script. 
The following line appears in the code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = "output/nice_plot.pdf")
```

This code saves a plot in a pdf file in the subdirectory `output/`.
For the file to be saved in the right directory, both Birte and Claudius must 
use the same working directory, otherwise the relative path would point to 
different locations on their computers (see the first section above).

Alternatively, Claudius could use an absolute path:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave(
  filename = "/Users/claudius/projects/R-Projekt-Birte/output/nice_plot.pdf")
```


While this makes sure that the file will be saved in the right place on *his*
computer, irrespective of his working directory, the likelihood that this code
also works when executed on Birte's computer is basically zero per cent:
almost certainly the script is saved on a different location on her computer. 
She would then need to adjust the absolute path to her needs, e.g. to:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave(
  filename = "/Users/Birte/projects/R-Projekt-Claudius/output/nice_plot.pdf")
```

This code, of course, would not work on Claudius' computer. A dilemma.
One remedy would be to adjust the script before using it. But this would be 
annoying and antiquated. 
It would also be very bad coding style: you should write your code always in
a way that it works on different computers. In the end, collaboration should be
fun, not pain.

Fortunately, the problem can be solved easily using the function `here::here()`.
Here *both* of them simpy write:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave(
  filename = here::here("output/nice_plot.pdf"))
```

The function `here::here()` automatically constructs an absolute path tailored
to the needs of their computers. When Claudius would call

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here::here("output/nice_plot.pdf")
```

the output would be:

```
"/Users/claudius/projects/R-Projekt-Birte/output/nice_plot.pdf"
```

And if Birte made this call on her computer the output would be:

```
"/Users/Birte/projects/R-Projekt-Claudius/output/nice_plot.pdf"
```

This way, the two can simply exchange the code with each other without
having to adjust the code to their local paths.
For this reason, and because of some other potential difficulties that we will
discuss later, you should *always* formulate paths using the 
`here::here()` function.
This is a little extra work, but it saves a lot of trouble in the long run.

For `here::here()` to work, however, you need to clarify the position of your
script relative to the root directory of your project at the very beginning of
your script. By 'root directory of your project' I mean the name of the directory
containing your `.Rproj` file.

To clarify the relative position of the script, you should add the following 
function call *in the first line of your script*:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here::i_am("Relative path to script.")
```

In the case you are working on the script `set_up_data.R`, which is located 
correctly in the `R`-directory as follows:

```{r usehere, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
# knitr::include_graphics("use_here_i_am.png", auto_pdf = T)
```

Then the first line of `set_up_data.R` should be:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here::i_am("R/set_up_data.R")
```

This ensures that subsequent calls of `here::here()` construct the correct 
absolute paths.

> **Note:** The call of `here::i_am()` at the very beginning of a script is an
exception to the important rule that a script should always start with a 
reference to the packages used within the script.
