This is one of the most underestimated topics. In this session you learn how
to adequately set up your working environment on your computer. This means
where you should save which files, which directory structure you should use,
and how to point the computer to other files on your computer. While this sounds
boring at first, taking seriously the insights from this session will save you
tons of hours of frustration in the future!

## 🎥 Lecture videos 

Currently, no videos are available for this session. Check out the tutorial
on 
[project setup](/content/tutorials/setting-up-an-r-project/index.qmd) 
instead.

## 📚 Mandatory Reading

- The tutorial [Setting up an R project](/content/tutorials/setting-up-an-r-project/index.qmd)

## Further Reading

While we do not cover this in this course, I highly recommend learning the 
version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/). 
Personally, I can recommend the following:

- [Very concise introduction](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) to Git
- Introduction to GitHub: [GitHub skills](https://skills.github.com/) and the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en)

## ✍️ Coursework

- Do the exercises `ProjectOrga` from the `DataScienceExercises` package that refer to setting up an R project
