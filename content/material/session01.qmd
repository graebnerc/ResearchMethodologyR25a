In this first week, we will cover what you can expect to learn from these exercises 
and how they differ from the main lecture. 
I will elaborate a bit on why I chose R for this course, what you can do
with it, and what has helped previous participants helped excelling in this 
course. Finally, I explain a bit what R is, how it relates to R Studio and LaTeX.
