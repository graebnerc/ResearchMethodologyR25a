In this lecture you learn the basics of using AI tools for coding tasks.
While no AI tool will help you to write code in a language you do not understand,
modern AI tools are well suited to assist you in writing code in a language you are familiar with.
Here we discuss some of the most common use cases for AI when it comes to the
development of R code. We focus on, first, getting a first sketch of an R script and, 
second, on using AI to help you find mistakes in your current code.

You also learn how important it is to provide the AI with context - 
something you can only do if you already know the basics of the programming 
language you and the AI are working with. Finally, we also touch upon some
AI-like tools and advice on how to avoid typos in code.
