This session is about recap and practice. We will do exercises on topics that
you suggest, and recap concepts you found particularly hard to grasp. To this
end, make sure you communicate your preferences on topics via Moodle until 
one week before this session.

## Script for the function example we were using
This is basically a step-by-step solution to the first function exercise of the
`Basics` exercise collection in the package `DataScienceExercises`.

## ✍️ Exercises for the class

*I suggest you create one R project environment for all the exercises of this *
*session*.

### Solving the CO2 exercise from session 10 together

Download data about the CO2 emissions for some countries of your choice from
the World Bank [website](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC)
for the years 2000 to 2020. Set up an R project, save the data, import it, and
make a line graph.

### Data wrangling I

Download and import the
[following data set](session12-material/education_income.csv) 
on education spending and income.

Compute, for each country, the percentage change of the spending from the
year 2010 to the year 2020 and save this as a variable called `perc_change`.

> **Hint:** The equation to compute the percentage change of a variable $X$ from
$t=1$ to $t=2$ is as follows:

$$g_X = \frac{X_{t=2}-X_{t=1}}{X_{t=1}}\cdot 100$$

Filter the data set such that there are no entries with a missing value in the
variable `perc_change`.

Save the new data set under a useful name in an adequate location.

### Data wrangling II

Use the same data set as in the exercise before.

Compute for each income group the average expense of education
over the whole period. Make sure missing
values are ignored. 

Save the new data set under a useful name in an adequate location.

### Visualization and Quarto

Create a Quarto document and make sure that the following
applies:

- Your name is set as the author of the file
- Your document is rendered to html format
- The title of the file is "Sessions 12 and 13: Recap and Practice"
- Sections are numbered
- There is a table of contents at the beginning of the document 

Then read in the following [data set](session12-material/child_mortality.csv) 
on GDP per capita and child mortality.

Summarize the data per country such that you have one mean value for 
child mortality and GDP per capita for each country (ignoring missing values).

Create a scatter plot, in which the y axis shows child mortality and the x axis 
GDP per capita.

Then create a second scatter plot, in which both variables are
transformed using the natural logarithm (using the R function `log()`).

In your rendered quarto document, there should be no R code visible, only the 
output. Also, warnings and messages should not be visible.
