Quarto is a modern multi-language version of *R Markdown*. As with its
predessessor, the idea is to provide people with the opportunity to write 
text and code into the very same document. This makes the creation of nice
looking and reproducible reports or paper very easy. Moreoever, with Quarto
it is very easy to create very nice papers, reports, websites or interactive
apps. This website, for example, is fully written in Quarto. In this lecture,
you learn everything you need to get started with writing your first Quarto 
documents. In fact, its really straighforward once you get the basic idea.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Exercise description

Create a new Quarto document where you set the title, date, and the author explicitly. Write a sample text that comprises‚Ä¶

- ...at least one level 1 heading
- ...at least two level 2 headings
- ...a YAML part that specifies that R code remains hidden by default
- ...one R chunk where both the output and the code is printed in the final document
- ...one R chunk that produces a simply ggplot object and where the code producing the plot is hidden

Then do the following:

1. Knit the document to html with a floating table of contents and a special theme.
2. Make the document available via Netlify Drop and add the possibility to download the underlying Rmd file. 
> Note: For Netlify Drop to work, the html file must be called `index.html```!

3. Knit the document to PDF and make sure that it includes a table of contents.
