A central concept in data science - and in applied statistics more generally - 
is that of *sampling*. This refers to the strategy of using (small) samples to 
learn about a (large) population. For example, if you wanted to understand the 
effect of TV advertising on the consumer behaviour of young men in Germany, 
you could study the whole population of young men in Germany. 
But since this is usually not feasible, you would rather take a sample of young 
men, study their behaviour and then generalise to the whole population. 
In this session we will discuss when and how this is possible. 
In this context, we will also learn about the concept of 
*Monte Carlo simulations* and two central concepts of probability theory 
underlying applied statistics: the central limit theorem and the law of large 
numbers, both of which underlie much of modern sampling theory.
