title: "üóìÔ∏è Session 4: Object types in R"
date: "2025-04-04"
date-modified: last-modified
---

In the first part of this session you 
learn some additional details about R packages and about the most important and most fundamental object types in R, such as
decimal numbers or words. While this might look a bit boring at first, understanding
these basic types is fundamental for all the more advanced (and exiting) stuff
in the future! 

In the second part of this session, you are then introduced to 
two more advanced object types in R. 
The two object types covered, factors and
data frames, are advanced in the sense that they can be thought of extensions
of some of the basic object types you encountered before: factors and special
kinds of integers, and data frames are special kinds of lists.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Coursework

- Do the `ObjectTypes1` exercises of the package `DataScienceExercises` 
for the first part on basic object types:

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Quick code for starting the exercises
```{r}
#| eval: false
learnr::run_tutorial(
  name = "ObjectTypes1", 
  package = "DataScienceExercises", 
  shiny_args=list("launch.browser"=TRUE))
```
:::

- For the second part do the `ObjectTypes2` exercises of the package `DataScienceExercises` 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Quick code for starting the exercises
```{r}
#| eval: false
learnr::run_tutorial(
  name = "ObjectTypes2", 
  package = "DataScienceExercises", 
  shiny_args=list("launch.browser"=TRUE))
```
