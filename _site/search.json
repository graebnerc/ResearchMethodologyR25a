    "text": "üìë The course in brief\nFocus: This course is part of the module Theoretical and Empirical Research Methodology. It complements the theoretical lectures by introducing you to the statistical programming language R and acquire practical knowledge about how to implement essential research tools and all theoretical concepts discussed during the main lecture in R.\nHow: The implementation lab comprises a mixture of (i) lectures, in which I introduce concepts in the classroom, (ii) automated hands-on exercises for you to do at home on your own and (iii) instructional videos for topics that are best learned and practiced by yourself. Of course, you are always invited to post your questions to the course forum on Moodle and more intricate problems can be solved in class.\nPrerequisites: The lab does not require you to have any prior knowledge in R or any other programming language. Depending on your prior knowledge or affinity to programming, the course will be quite demanding, but equip you with computational skills that are most valuable both within academia and the business world.\n\n\nüéØ Learning Objectives\n\nUse R together with the integrated development environment R Studio\nUnderstand the use of R packages to perform specific data analytic tasks\nWrite reproducible data analysis reports using Quarto\nTransform raw data into tidy data, which is suitable for further analysis\nChoose and justify the correct visualization approach, and create appealing visualizations using the R package ggplot2\nImplement and interpret linear regression models with numerical and categorial variables\nAnalyze experimental data in R\n\n\n The main course on moodle"

Use suitable helper functions to create this vector quickly.\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Basic object types II\nConsider the following vector:\n\nex_2_vec &lt;- c(1, \"2\", FALSE)\n\n\nWhat is the type of this vector? Why?\nWhat happens if you coerce this vector into type integer? Why?\nWhat does sum(is.na(x)) tell you about a vector x? What is happening here?\nIs it a good idea to use as.integer() on double characters to round them to the next integer? Why (not)? What other ways are there to do the rounding?\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Define a function\nCreate functions that take a vector as input and returns:\n\nThe last value.\nEvery element except the last value and any missing values.\nOnly even numbers.\n\n\nHint: Use the operation x %% y to get the remainder from diving x by y, the so called ‚Äòmodulo y‚Äô. For even numbers, the modulo 2 is zero.\n\nApply your function to the following example vector:\n\nex_3_vec &lt;- c(1, -8, 99, 3, NA, 3, -0.5)\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Lists\n\nCreate a list that contains three elements called 'a', 'b' and 'c'. The first element should correspond to a double vector with the elements 1.5, -2.9 and 99. The second element should correspond to a character vector with the elments 'Hello', '3', and 'EUF'. The third element should contain three times the entry FALSE.\nTransform this list into a data.frame and a tibble. Then apply str() to get information about the respective structure. How do the results differ?\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Data frames and the study semester distribution at EUF\nThe package DataScienceExercises contains a data set called EUFstudentsemesters, which contains information about the distribution of study semesters of enrolled students at the EUF in 2021. You can shortcut the data set as follows:\n\neuf_semesters &lt;- DataScienceExercises::EUFstudentsemesters\n\n\nWhat happens if you extract the column with study semesters as a vector and transform it into a double?\nWhat is the average study semester of those students being in their 8th or earlier semester?\nHow many students are in their 9th or higher study semester?\nWhat does typeof(euf_semesters) return and why?"

Why?\n\n\ntypeof(ex_2_vec)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nAtomic vectors only contain objects of the same type, and there is a hierarchy. Elements that themselves are of a type lower in the hierarchy are coerced to the same type as the object highest in the hierarchy. The hierarchy is as as follows:\n\ncharacter\ndouble\ninteger\nlogical\n\nTherefore, the type of ex_2_vec is character. The underlying reason is that you can, for instance, always transform a double value into a character but not vice versa.\n\nWhat happens if you coerce this vector into type integer? Why?\n\n\nas.integer(ex_2_vec)\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\n\n[1]  1  2 NA\n\n\nBecause integer is lower in the hierarchy than character, the transformation is not straightforward. By coincidence, the first two elements can actually be coerced into integers (albeit maybe not with the expected result), but there is no way you can transform the logical value FALSE into an integer, which is why a missing value is produced.\n\nWhat does sum(is.na(x)) tell you about a vector x? What is happening here?\n\n\nx &lt;- c(1,2,3,NA,NA,8)\n\nFirst, is.na(x) creates a vector with logical values indicating whether a value of the original vector is missing (i.e.¬†NA):\n\nis.na(x)\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nThen, sum() computes the sum over this vecor of boolean values:\n\nsum(is.na(x))\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nHere, TRUE counts as one and FALSE as zero, so sum() gives the number of cases in which is.na(x) has evaluated to TRUE:\n\nIs it a good idea to use as.integer() on double characters to round them to the next integer? Why (not)? What other ways are there to do the rounding?\n\nNo, because as.integer() is not acutally rounding numbers (as, for example, as.integer(2.1) would make you think), but only removing the decimal part of the number:\n\nas.integer(2.9) # you might expect 2...\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nBetter use round():\n\nround(2.9)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Define a function\nCreate functions that take a vector as input and returns:\n\nThe last value.\n\n\nget_last_val &lt;- function(x){\n  last_val &lt;- x[length(x)]\n  return(last_val)\n}\n\n\nEvery element except the last value and any missing values.\n\n\nget_beginning &lt;- function(x){\n  beginning &lt;- x[-length(x)] # Removes last value\n  na_positions &lt;- which(is.na(beginning)) # Get positions of NA values\n  beginning_nonas &lt;- beginning[-na_positions] # Removes these values\n  return(beginning_nonas)\n} \n\n\nOnly even numbers.\n\n\nHint: Use the operation x %% y to get the remainder from diving x by y, the so called ‚Äòmodulo y‚Äô. For even numbers, the modulo 2 is zero.\n\n\nget_even &lt;- function(x){\n  modulo_2s &lt;- x%%2 # Module 2 is zero for even numbers only\n  even_nbs &lt;- x[modulo_2s==0] # Keep only those for which modulo 2 is zero\n  na_positions &lt;- which(is.na(even_nbs)) # Get positions of NA values\n  even_nbs_nonas &lt;- even_nbs[-na_positions] # Removes these values\n  return(even_nbs_nonas)\n}\n\nApply your function to the following example vector:\n\nex_3_vec &lt;- c(1, -8, 99, 3, NA, 4, -0.5, 50)\n\n\nget_last_val(ex_3_vec)\n\n[1] 50\n\nget_beginning(ex_3_vec)\n\n[1]  1.0 -8.0 99.0  3.0  4.0 -0.5\n\nget_even(ex_3_vec)\n\n[1] -8  4 50\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Lists\n\nCreate a list that contains three elements called 'a', 'b' and 'c'. The first element should correspond to a double vector with the elements 1.5, -2.9 and 99. The second element should correspond to a character vector with the elments 'Hello', '3', and 'EUF'. The third element should contain three times the entry FALSE.\n\n\nex_4_list &lt;- list(\n  'a' = c(1.5, -2.9, 99),\n  'b' = c('Hello', \"'3'\", 'EUF'),\n  'c' = rep(FALSE, 3)\n)\n\n\nTransform this list into a data.frame and a tibble. Then apply str() to get information about the respective structure. How do the results differ?\n\n\nex_4_df &lt;- as.data.frame(ex_4_list)\nex_4_tb &lt;- tibble::as_tibble(ex_4_list)\nstr(ex_4_list)\n\nList of 3\n $ a: num [1:3] 1.5 -2.9 99\n $ b: chr [1:3] \"Hello\" \"'3'\" \"EUF\"\n $ c: logi [1:3] FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\nstr(ex_4_df)\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ a: num  1.5 -2.9 99\n $ b: chr  \"Hello\" \"'3'\" \"EUF\"\n $ c: logi  FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\nstr(ex_4_tb)\n\ntibble [3 √ó 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ a: num [1:3] 1.5 -2.9 99\n $ b: chr [1:3] \"Hello\" \"'3'\" \"EUF\"\n $ c: logi [1:3] FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nstr() only differs with regard to the first line describing the type.\n\n\nExercise 5: Data frames and the study semester distribution at EUF\nThe package DataScienceExercises contains a data set called EUFstudentsemesters, which contains information about the distribution of study semesters of enrolled students at the EUF in 2021. You can shortcut the data set as follows:\n\neuf_semesters &lt;- DataScienceExercises::EUFstudentsemesters\n\n\nWhat happens if you extract the column with study semesters as a vector and transform it into a double?\n\n\nunique(euf_semesters[[\"Semester\"]])\n\n[1] \"6\"           \"4\"           \"2\"           \"8\"           \"9 or higher\"\n[6] \"7\"           \"5\"           \"3\"           \"1\"          \n\nsemesters &lt;- as.double(euf_semesters[[\"Semester\"]])\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\nunique(semesters)\n\n[1]  6  4  2  8 NA  7  5  3  1\n\n\nWe see that the previous entry \"9 or higher\" has been transformed into NA.\n\nWhat is the average study semester of those students being in their 8th or earlier semester?\n\n\nmean(semesters, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 4.177026\n\n\n\nHow many students are in their 9th or higher study semester?\n\n\nsum(euf_semesters$Semester==\"9 or higher\")\n\n[1] 469\n\n\n\nWhat does typeof(euf_semesters) return and why?\n\n\ntypeof(euf_semesters)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nIt returns list, because while euf_semesters is a tibble, typeof() always gives the underlying basic object type. For tibbles, this is list."

And the goal of this session is to equip you with the tools that you need to turn the often messy raw data into tidy data. These skills are important because they make you independent: you will be able to prepare any data you find or create yourself such that you can further process it, and you will not rely on others to provide you data in a particular form."

Rather, the two should be understood as relative descriptions of data, meaning that it is more straightforward to speak of a data set that is longer relative to another one, rather than a long data set per se.\nHere is an example for a rather long data set:\n\n\n   country  year variable    value\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;char&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017    unemp     3.75\n2: Germany  2017      gdp 53071.46\n3: Germany  2018    unemp     3.38\n4: Germany  2018      gdp 53431.39\n5:  Greece  2017    unemp    21.49\n6:  Greece  2017      gdp 28604.86\n7:  Greece  2018    unemp    19.29\n8:  Greece  2018      gdp 29141.17\n\n\nHere, we have one column identifying the variable, the value of which is stored in a separate column. This means that the data is relatively ‚Äòlong‚Äô in the sense of having many rows. At the same time, it is relatively ‚Äònarrow‚Äô in the sense of not having too many columns since the variable identifier is kept in a single column.\nContrast this with an example for a rather wide data set, where each variable has its own column:\n\n\n   country  year unemp      gdp\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017  3.75 53071.46\n2: Germany  2018  3.38 53431.39\n3:  Greece  2017 21.49 28604.86\n4:  Greece  2018 19.29 29141.17\n\n\nWhile the number of columns remains the same, the data set has relatively more columns as compared to the rows. At the same time, it tends to be shorter in the sense of having fewer rows.1\nWhile the long format is often easier to read and preferable when communicating data to humans, making data tidy often involves the task of making data ‚Äòlonger‚Äô."

This is done - surprise - via the function ¬¥dplyr::select()`.\nThere are different ways for selecting columns. In any case, the first argument is, again, data, i.e.¬†the data set considered. In the present case, we will refer to data_raw:\n\ndata_raw\n\n   country  year unemp      gdp\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017  3.75 53071.46\n2: Germany  2018  3.38 53431.39\n3:  Greece  2017 21.49 28604.86\n4:  Greece  2018 19.29 29141.17\n\n\nThen we can now select columns using one of the following two options. First, you may refer to columns via their name:\n\ndata_raw %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(country, year, unemp)\n\n   country  year unemp\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017  3.75\n2: Germany  2018  3.38\n3:  Greece  2017 21.49\n4:  Greece  2018 19.29\n\n\nBut this is often error-prone. Thus, it is usually better to refer to the columns via selection helpers, which is also the most flexible version. While we will learn about more selection helpers later, here we will mainly use dplyr::all_of(), which accepts a character vector of column names:\n\ndata_raw %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(dplyr::all_of(c(\"country\", \"year\", \"gdp\")))\n\n   country  year      gdp\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017 53071.46\n2: Germany  2018 53431.39\n3:  Greece  2017 28604.86\n4:  Greece  2018 29141.17\n\n\n\nCaution: Do not forget the c()! Otherwise:\n\n\ndata_raw %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(dplyr::all_of(\"country\", \"year\", \"gdp\"))\n\nError in `dplyr::select()`:\n‚Ñπ In argument: `dplyr::all_of(\"country\", \"year\", \"gdp\")`.\nCaused by error in `dplyr::all_of()`:\n! unused arguments (\"year\", \"gdp\")\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to define the column vector first:\n\n\ncols2keep &lt;- c(\"country\", \"year\", \"gdp\")\ndata_raw %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(dplyr::all_of(cols2keep))\n\n   country  year      gdp\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017 53071.46\n2: Germany  2018 53431.39\n3:  Greece  2017 28604.86\n4:  Greece  2018 29141.17\n\n\n\nSelection helpers allow you to specify the columns to be selected more generally. For instance, dplyr::ends_with() allows you to select all colums that end with a certain pattern:\n\n\ndata_raw %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(dplyr::ends_with(\"p\"))\n\n   unemp      gdp\n   &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1:  3.75 53071.46\n2:  3.38 53431.39\n3: 21.49 28604.86\n4: 19.29 29141.17\n\n\nIn any case, you can also specify the columns you want to drop. To this end, just add a - in front of the selection command:\n\ndata_raw %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-unemp, -gdp)\n\n   country  year\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1: Germany  2017\n2: Germany  2018\n3:  Greece  2017\n4:  Greece  2018"

    "text": "Merging data sets\nOften you need to obtain data from different sources. To merge all your data in one single data set, you need to use one of the *_join() functions of the dplyr-package. These functions all merge two data sets, but the way they do it is different. Below we illustrate the most common joins (so called mutating joins).4\nAs a guiding example we use the following two data sets:\nFirst, data on income inequality from the SWIID data base:\n\ngini_join\n\n   country  year  gini\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1:  Greece  2015  33.1\n2:  Greece  2017  32.2\n\n\nSecond, data on GDP per capita from the World Bank:\n\ngdp_join\n\n   country  year      gdp\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017 53071.46\n2: Germany  2018 53431.39\n3:  Greece  2017 28604.86\n4:  Greece  2018 29141.17\n\n\nWe will consider the behavior of the following four functions:\n\ndplyr::left_join()\ndplyr::right_join()\ndplyr::full_join()\ndplyr::inner_join()\n\nAll of them accept the following arguments:\n\nx and y: the two data sets to be merged\nby: a vector or a named vector indicating on which columns the data sets should be merged\n\nIts easier to understand their behavior if you contrast them directly with each other. First, dplyr::left_join() joins the data sets on those columns mentioned in by, but only keeps those rows for which x contains an observation:\n\ndplyr::left_join(x = gdp_join, y = gini_join, by = c(\"country\", \"year\"))\n\n   country  year      gdp  gini\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017 53071.46    NA\n2: Germany  2018 53431.39    NA\n3:  Greece  2017 28604.86  32.2\n4:  Greece  2018 29141.17    NA\n\n\nThis might introduce NAs into the columns of y, but not of x. It is the other way around for dplyr::right_join(): it only keeps those rows for which y contains an observation:\n\ndplyr::right_join(x = gdp_join, y = gini_join, by = c(\"country\", \"year\"))\n\n   country  year      gdp  gini\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1:  Greece  2017 28604.86  32.2\n2:  Greece  2015       NA  33.1\n\n\ndplyr::inner_join() is the most restrictive option, keeping only those rows for which both x and y contain an observation (i.e.¬†it never introduces NAs):\n\ndplyr::inner_join(x = gdp_join, y = gini_join, by = c(\"country\", \"year\"))\n\n   country  year      gdp  gini\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1:  Greece  2017 28604.86  32.2\n\n\nFinally, dplyr::full_join() contains all rows that occur at least in x or y, i.e.¬†it might introduce NAs in both the columns of x and y:\n\ndplyr::full_join(x = gdp_join, y = gini_join, by = c(\"country\", \"year\"))\n\n   country  year      gdp  gini\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017 53071.46    NA\n2: Germany  2018 53431.39    NA\n3:  Greece  2017 28604.86  32.2\n4:  Greece  2018 29141.17    NA\n5:  Greece  2015       NA  33.1\n\n\nTwo final remarks: first, the types of the columns on which you merge the data sets must be equal, otherwise R throws an error:\n\ngini_join &lt;- dplyr::mutate(gini_join, year=as.character(year))\ndplyr::left_join(x = gdp_join, y = gini_join, by = c(\"country\", \"year\"))\n\nError in `dplyr::left_join()`:\n! Can't join `x$year` with `y$year` due to incompatible types.\n‚Ñπ `x$year` is a &lt;integer&gt;.\n‚Ñπ `y$year` is a &lt;character&gt;.\n\n\nJust enforce the correct data type before merging:\n\ngini_join %&gt;% \n  dplyr::mutate(year=as.integer(year)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::left_join(x = gdp_join, y = ., by = c(\"country\", \"year\"))\n\n   country  year      gdp  gini\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017 53071.46    NA\n2: Germany  2018 53431.39    NA\n3:  Greece  2017 28604.86  32.2\n4:  Greece  2018 29141.17    NA\n\n\nSecond, you can also merge on columns with different names by passing named vectors to by:\n\ngini_join &lt;- gini_join %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year=as.double(year)) %&gt;%\n  select(-year)\ngini_join\n\n   country  gini  Year\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1:  Greece  33.1  2015\n2:  Greece  32.2  2017\n\n\nThen this does not work any more:\n\ndplyr::left_join(\n  x = gdp_join, y = gini_join, \n  by = c(\"country\", \"year\"))\n\nError in `dplyr::left_join()`:\n! Join columns in `y` must be present in the data.\n‚úñ Problem with `year`.\n\n\nBut the named vector fixes it:\n\ndplyr::left_join(\n  x = gdp_join, y = gini_join, \n  by = c(\"country\", \"year\"=\"Year\"))\n\n   country  year      gdp  gini\n    &lt;char&gt; &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1: Germany  2017 53071.46    NA\n2: Germany  2018 53431.39    NA\n3:  Greece  2017 28604.86  32.2\n4:  Greece  2018 29141.17    NA"

    "text": "Grouping and summarising data\nThe final challenge we consider involves the application of two functions (at least in most cases): dplyr::group_by() and dplyr::summarize().\ndplyr::group_by() is usually used within pipes and groups a data set according to an arbitrary number of variables, each of which must refer to one (and only one) column. It produces a grouped data set:\n\ndata_raw_grouped &lt;- data_raw %&gt;%\n  dplyr::group_by(country)\ndata_raw_grouped\n\n# A tibble: 4 √ó 4\n# Groups:   country [2]\n  country  year unemp    gdp\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Germany  2017  3.75 53071.\n2 Germany  2018  3.38 53431.\n3 Greece   2017 21.5  28605.\n4 Greece   2018 19.3  29141.\n\n\nAs you can see, the data set is now grouped by the variable country. We can specify the grouping variables the same way we selected columns in the context of dplyr::select() (see above).\nGrouped data sets are usually not interesting in itself. You can ungroup them via dplyr::ungroup():\n\ndata_raw_grouped %&gt;%\n  dplyr::ungroup()\n\n# A tibble: 4 √ó 4\n  country  year unemp    gdp\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Germany  2017  3.75 53071.\n2 Germany  2018  3.38 53431.\n3 Greece   2017 21.5  28605.\n4 Greece   2018 19.3  29141.\n\n\nThey are most useful if used in conjunction with dplyr::summarise(), which summarizes variables. While it can be used without dplyr::group_by(), it is most useful if it is applied to grouped data sets: then it computes summary statistics for each group.\n\ndata_raw %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    avg_gdp=mean(gdp)\n  )\n\n   avg_gdp\n1 41062.22\n\n\n\ndata_raw_grouped %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    avg_gdp=mean(gdp)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 √ó 2\n  country avg_gdp\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Germany  53251.\n2 Greece   28873.\n\n\nYou can also summarized more than one column:\n\ndata_raw_grouped %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    avg_gdp=mean(gdp),\n    median_unemp=median(unemp)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 √ó 3\n  country avg_gdp median_unemp\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Germany  53251.         3.57\n2 Greece   28873.        20.4 \n\n\nNote that dplyr::summarise() drops all columns that it is not asked to compute summary statistics for, except potential grouping variables. There are also some advanced features of the functions, which are explained in the official documentation."

This means that R chooses the right data type for each column automatically. Sometimes, however, this detection fails and you need to specify the column types manually. But even if the automatic recognition works, there are some good reasons for playing save and specify the column types yourself:\n\nYou will notice more easily if there is a problem with a column, e.g.¬†if a word occurs in a column that consists exclusively of numbers. occurs. If you did not specify this column manually as double, data.table::fread() would simply interpret it silently as a character and you would later wonder later why you cannot calculate an average for the column;\nYour code will be more transparent and easier to read if one immediately knows what kind of data you are importing\nThe import process will be much faster if you provide the column types yourself and the function does not need to guess the types itself.\n\nOne situation where specifying column types yourself is extremely important is when a column contains numerical codes that might contain a leading zero, e.g.¬†when the data contain HS product codes, such as here:\ncommoditycode,complexity\n0101,0.06\n0102,-0.49\n0103,0.51\n0104,-1.12\n0105,-0.17\nAssuming the file is called exp_data_hs.csv and also is stored in data/tidy/, we might try to import it using the default argument values:\n\nfile_path &lt;- here::here(\"data/tidy/exp_data_hs.csv\")\nexp_prod_data &lt;- data.table::fread(file = file_path)\nexp_prod_data &lt;- tibble::as_tibble(exp_prod_data)\nexp_prod_data\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 2\n  commoditycode complexity\n          &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1           101       0.06\n2           102      -0.49\n3           103       0.51\n4           104      -1.12\n5           105      -0.17\n\n\nAs you can see, data.table::fread() interpreted the column commoditycode as double. But since numbers do not have leading zeros, these are removed silently, meaning that R does not issue a warning message. This is dangerous and might come with serious misinterpretations later on. To avoid this, you must choose the column types yourself via the colClasses argument, by simply specifying a vector with the data types:\n\nfile_path &lt;- here::here(\"data/tidy/exp_data_hs.csv\")\nexp_prod_data &lt;- data.table::fread(\n  file = daten_pfad, colClasses = c(\"character\", \"double\")\n  )\ntibble::as_tibble(exp_prod_data)\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 2\n  commoditycode complexity\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0101                0.06\n2 0102               -0.49\n3 0103                0.51\n4 0104               -1.12\n5 0105               -0.17\n\n\nAs you can see, encoding the column commoditycode as character preserves the leading zeros and the correct product codes.\nFor data sets with many columns it is often tedious to specify column types one by one. Here it might be useful to use the function rep(): it saves space if, for instance, 6 subsequent columns are all of type double. In this case you may just write rep(\"double\" , 6)."

At the same time, opening very large data files in R Studio or even a text editor can slow down your computer considerably.\nThus, it is advisable to read in the first 3-5 rows, inspect them, and then read in the whole data set with the right specification for colClasses.\nYou can load only the first \\(n\\) rows by using the argument nrows:\n\nexp_data &lt;- tibble::as_tibble(data.table::fread(\n  file = here::here(\"data/tidy/exp_data.csv\"), \n  nrows = 1)\n  )\nexp_data\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 3\n  iso2c  year exports\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AT     2012    54.0\n\n\nIn other instances, you might also want to skip the first \\(n\\) rows. This is often the case if your file contains some general introductory header, which is placed before the actual data set. Such data with a header might look like this:\nThis is awesome data from 2012-2014\nIt was compiled be Claudius\nHe also added this useless header\niso2c,year,Exporte\nAT,2012,53.97\nAT,2013,53.44\nAT,2014,53.38\n\nIn this case, you definitely want to ignore the first three rows when importing the data set. Otherwise you will get hodgepodge:\n\nexp_data &lt;- data.table::fread(\n  file = here::here(\"data/tidy/exp_data_header.csv\")\n  )\ntibble::as_tibble(exp_data)\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 6\n  V1    It    was   compiled be      Claudius\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 He    also  added this     useless header  \n\n\nTo ignore the first three rows just set skip to 3:\n\nexp_data &lt;- tibble::as_tibble(data.table::fread(\n  file = here::here(\"data/tidy/exp_data_header.csv\"), \n  skip = 3)\n  )\nexp_data\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 3\n  iso2c  year Exporte\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AT     2012    54.0\n2 AT     2013    53.4\n3 AT     2014    53.4\n\n\nAgain, the automatic detection of fread() often works quite well when it comes to the identification of useless headers, but better be prepared to use skip whenever necessary."

In case you are using Mac OS and want to use Homebrew, its best to use this formula.\nImportant for Mac user: There are different versions of R for Intel chips, and Apple chips (M1, M2, etc.). It is very important that you install the correct version. If you are not sure whether your Mac contains a chip from Intel or Apple, click on the Apple symbol in the upper left of the screen, then click on About this Mac and you can see which processor your Mac is using in the new window. If you have an Apple chip, always install R for the so called arm64 architecture. Intel chip users must use the x86_64 architecture instead.\n\nOnly Windows: Install RTools\nIf you are using Windows, it is necessary to install RTools, which is required if you want to use packages written by others that are not officially released. To do so, simply visit the following website, download the installer, and install the software:\nWhen asked during the installation process, do not select the box for Add rtools to system PATH, but do select the box for Save version information to registry.\n\n\nOnly Mac: Command Line Developer Tools\nThe Command Line Developer Tools could be thought of as the Mac pendant to RTools. These allow you to build R packages from source (meaning, basically, you can use packages that are in early stages of distribution, or packages that are not released on the official R servers).\nThe easiest way to install them is to open the App Terminal, and then to type\nxcode-select --install\nand press Enter. Then a pop up window will open and allow you to install the software."

The version you are currently using is shown as soon as you start R.\nPlease note: if you installed R anew in the previous step, you do not need to update it. The information on updating R is mainly relevant for people who have installed R already some time ago.\n\nMacOS users\nFor MacOS users, the easiest route to update R is to just re-install the most current version from the R Homepage. Keep in mind that in this case you might need to re-install all previously installed packages. If you have a lot of packages installed that you want to keep, the following steps facilitates the re-installation process. First, save a list with all the packages you installed yourself. To this end type the following into the R console:1\npackage_overview &lt;- installed.packages()\npackage_names &lt;- as.vector(\n  package_overview[is.na(package_overview[,\"Priority\"]), 1])\nsave(package_names, file=\"r_packages.rda\")\nAfter re-installing R, you then need to load the file you previously saved and identify the missing packages. You can use the following code to do so if you are in the working directory in which you saved the file \"r_packages.rda\":\nload(\"r_packages.rda\")\npackages_new &lt;- installed.packages()\npackages_new_ &lt;- as.vector(packages_new[is.na(packages_new[,\"Priority\"]), 1])\nmissing_packages &lt;- setdiff(package_names, packages_new_)\ninstall.packages(missing_packages)\nupdate.packages()\n\n\nWindows users\nWindows users have a slightly more convenient route available to them: the installr package. It does not require you to re-install your packages. Just type the following code into your R console:2\ninstall.packages(\"installr\")\nlibrary(installr)\nupdateR(TRUE)\nFor more information see the package website.\n\n\nLinux users\nLinux users simply install R via their package manager. A quick search on Google should provide you with the information that are relevant for your particular Linux distribution. Updating is usually straightforward as well: just run the respective command from your package manager."

    "title": "Fundamental object types in R II: Vectors",
    "section": "Atomic vectors",
    "text": "Atomic vectors\nThis makes it easy to classify atomic vectors in more detail: we usually say that the type of atomic vector is the type of the object it encompasses. Four major types of atomic vectors in this sense exist:\n\nlogical (logical values): there are only two relevant logical values: TRUE und FALSE3\ninteger (whole numbers): this type should be self-explanatory. Less intuitive is the rule that in order to define an integer in R you need to type the number followed by the letter L such that R interprets the number as an integer.4 Examples are 1L, -400L or 10L.\n\ndouble (decimal numbers): these should be self-explanatory as well. Examples are 1.5, 0.0, or -500.32.\nWhole and decimal numbers are often summarized in the category numeric. However, the use of numeric is almost always confusing, and many functions show counter-intuitive behavior when this category is used. I recommend you to never use it.\ncharacter (words): these can contain all kinds of tokens and are characterized by the fact that they always start and end with \" (or '). Examples would be \"Hello\", \"500\" or \"1_2_Three\".\n\nAs indicated above, an atomic vector only comprises elements of the same type. In this context, we should mention, however, the at first sight ‚Äòstrange‚Äô data type NA, which denotes a missing value:5 whenever an element of a vector is missing, e.g.¬†when the vector is used to store observations of subjects that have participated in an experiment, and for some subjects the observation is missing, we will use NA.6\n\nTesting and coercing types\nIn the following we will study the different types of atomic vectors and their typical behavior in more detail. But before doing so we should introduce the function typeof(): it helps us to identify the type of an object in the first place. To see how, lets call the function with the object (or the name of the object) we are interested about:\n\ntypeof(2L)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\n\nx &lt;- 22.0\ntypeof(x)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nThere is also a family of functions that allows us to test whether an object is actual of a certain type or not. The general syntax here is is.*(). For instance:\n\nx &lt;- 1.0\nis.integer(x)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\nis.double(x)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThis function always returns an object of type logical:\n\ny &lt;- is.double(x)\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\nWe can also try to transform objects from one type into another. We call this process ‚Äòcoercion‚Äô an the general syntax is as.*()*. For instance:\n\nx &lt;- \"2\"\nprint(\n  typeof(x)\n)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nx &lt;- as.double(x)\nprint(\n  typeof(x)\n)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nSuch a transformation is, however, not always possible:\n\nas.double(\"Hello\")\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nSince R does not know how to turn the word ‚ÄòHello‚Äô into a decimal number, it transforms it into a ‚Äòmissing value‚Äô - NA.\nFor the basic types discussed above there is a logical hierarchy of feasible transformations: logical ‚Üí integer ‚Üí double ‚Üí character, meaning that you can always transform a decimal number into a word, but not vice versa.\n\nTransgression: Why change the types of objects anyway? Data types are extremely important for a programming language because otherwise it would remain unclear how mathematical operations could be applied to different objects such as numbers or words. You will transform objects yourself especially when you want to use a certain operation that is only defined for a certain type of object, and the object you are dealing with has been stored as a different type. This can happen, for example, when you read in data or translate words into numerical values yourself. If unexpected errors occur in your code with cryptic error messages, it is always a good idea to check the types of the objects used and transform them if necessary.\n\n\nx &lt;- 2\ny &lt;- as.character(x)\nprint(y)\n\n[1] \"2\"\n\nz &lt;- as.double(y) # This works\nprint(z)\n\n[1] 2\n\nk &lt;- as.double(\"Hallo\") # This does not work\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\nprint(k)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nWhen transforming logical values, TRUE counts as 1 and FALSE as 0, a fact that will come in handy later on:\n\nx &lt;- TRUE\nas.integer(x)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\ny &lt;- FALSE\nas.integer(y)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nSince it is not always clear when R issues a warning for transformations that are incompatible with the hierarchy just introduced and when it does not, you should always be cautious!\nMoreover, transformations might change the properties of the transformed objects implicitly in unexpected ways. For instance, a transformation from a decimal number to a whole number can lead to unexpected rounding behavior:\n\nx &lt;- 1.99\nas.integer(x)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nAnother example is the following:\n\nz &lt;- as.logical(99)\nprint(z)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nSuch implicit changes of the object properties do not necessary come with a warning message, so one should always be careful when transforming objects!\nIn many cases, functions do the necessary transformations of their arguments automatically. In most cases this is very practical:\n\nx &lt;- 1L # Integer\ny &lt;- 2.0 # Double\nz &lt;- x + y\ntypeof(z)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nBut it can be dangerous in some cases as well.\nWhen adding up logical values they are transformed to numbers:\n\nx &lt;- TRUE\ny &lt;- FALSE\nz &lt;- x + y # TRUE counts as 1, FALSE as 0\nprint(z) \n\n[1] 1\n\n\nThis is useful if you want to know, for instance, how many elements of a vector meet a certain logical criterion:\n\nx &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)\nsum(x &gt; 3)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nIn all these cases it is very important to stay informed about the types of objects you are dealing with. To help you out, the following table contains an overview over the most important transformation and test functions:\n\n\n\nType\nTest\nTransformation\n\n\n\n\nlogical\nis.logical\nas.logical\n\n\ndouble\nis.double\nas.double\n\n\ninteger\nis.integer\nas.integer\n\n\ncharacter\nis.character\nas.character\n\n\nfunction\nis.function\nas.function\n\n\nNA\nis.na\nNA\n\n\nNULL\nis.null\nas.null\n\n\n\nA final remark on scalars: with scalar we usually refer to ‚Äòsingle numbers‚Äô, such as 2. There is no such concept in R: 2 is a vector with one element (or: of length 1). Thus, we do not distinguish the type of a vector with or more than one elements.\nNote: As you might have guessed already, we use the function c() to create longer vectors:\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nx\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nWe can also use this function to concatenate vectors:\n\nx &lt;- 1:3 # Shortcut for: x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\ny &lt;- 4:6\nz &lt;- c(x, y)\nz\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\nSince atomic vectors can only contain objects of the same type, one might expect the following code, which tries to concatenate objects of different types, to produce an error:\n\nx &lt;- c(1, \"Hallo\")\n\nBut this is not what happens! R transforms the objects according to the hierarchy discussed above:\nlogical ‚Üí integer ‚Üí double ‚Üí character. Due to the absence of errors or warning messages, such operations are a regular source for mistakes.\nNote: The length of a vector corresponds to its numbers of elements. We can ‚Äòmeasure‚Äô its length using the function length():\n\nx =  c(1, 2, 3)\nlen_x &lt;- length(x)\nlen_x\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\nTransgression: How large can an integer become? In R, objects of type integer are stored as 32-bit files. This means that for each single integer, 32 bits of storage are available on your computer. This implies that really large numbers cannot be stored as integers, simply because the 32 bits are not sufficient:\n\n\nx &lt;- 2147483647L\ntypeof(x)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\n\ny &lt;- 2147483648L\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the largest number that we can store as 32-bit integer is 2147483647. Larger numbers must be stored as double. The drawback of saving numbers in this type is, however, the risk of a loss of precision. If you want to avoid this you could try to save an integer as a 64 bit integer. This possibility has been added to R later to save large numbers as integers (something that happens faster than you think). To do so we must use the package7 bit64:\n\n\nz &lt;- bit64::as.integer64(2147483648)\nbit64::is.integer64(z)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nBecause this is a data type that has been added to R later, several functions do not work with 64-bit integers if the package bit64 is not installed. Moreover, several standard functions return very irritating outputs:\n\n\ntypeof(z)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\n\nFor this reason, and because bit64 is not part of the standard installation of R, you should avoid storing large numbers as integer64 whenever possible. Very large numbers should be stored as double or, when precision is a serious issue, you should scale them down and then save them as integer.\n\n\n\nLogical operations\nThe logical values TRUE and FALSE are often the result of logical operations, such as ‚ÄòIs 2 larger than 1?‚Äô. Such logical operations occur very frequently and its a good idea to familiarize yourself with the logical operators. You can find an overview in the following table:\n\n\n\nOperator\nFunction in R\nExample\n\n\n\n\nlarger\n&gt;\n2&gt;1\n\n\nsmaller\n&lt;\n2&lt;4\n\n\nequal\n==\n4==3\n\n\nlarger or equal\n&gt;=\n8&gt;=8\n\n\nsmaller or equal\n&lt;=\n5&lt;=9\n\n\nnot equal\n!=\n4!=5\n\n\nand\n&\nx&lt;90 & x&gt;55\n\n\nor\n|\nx&lt;90 | x&gt;55\n\n\neither or\nxor()\nxor(2&lt;1, 2&gt;1)\n\n\nnot\n!\n!(x==2)\n\n\nis true\nisTRUE()\nisTRUE(1&gt;2)\n\n\n\nThe result of such logical operations is always a logical value:\n\nx &lt;- 4\ny &lt;- x == 8\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\nYou may also test longer vectors:\n\nx &lt;- 1:3\nx&lt;2\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nTests can also be chained:\n\nx &lt;- 1L\nx&gt;2 | x&lt;2 & (is.double(x) & x!=0)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nSince many mathematical operations interpret TRUE as 1, it is easy to check how often a certain condition is met:\n\nx &lt;- 1:50 \nsmaller_20 &lt;- x&lt;20 \nprint(\n  sum(smaller_20) # How many elements are smaller then 20?\n  )\n\n[1] 19\n\nprint(\n  sum(smaller_20/length(x)) # Whats the share of these elements?\n)\n\n[1] 0.38\n\n\n\n\nVectorization\nThe chained operation we just saw is an example for vectorizing an operation. This means that the same operation is applied to many elements, all of which are concatenated as a vector. For instance, if you want to compute the square root of the numbers 5, 6 and 7 you could do:\n\nsqrt(5)\n\n[1] 2.236068\n\nsqrt(6)\n\n[1] 2.44949\n\nsqrt(7)\n\n[1] 2.645751\n\n\nOr you vectorize the operation:\n\nsqrt(c(5,6,7))\n\n[1] 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751\n\n\nVectorizing operations is very useful since it speeds up the computations considerably. Vectorized operations are far more efficient and faster than applying the operation to each element of the vector separately. Thus, whenever you need to apply a certain operation more than once you should always think about using vectorization.8\n\n\nMore on words\nWords are distinguished by the fact that their beginning and their end gets indicated by the symbol ' or \":\n\nx &lt;- \"Hello\"\ntypeof(x)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\ny &lt;- 'Bye!'\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nJust as other kinds of atomic vectors, they can by concatenated using c():\n\nz &lt;- c(x, \"und\", y)\nz\n\n[1] \"Hello\" \"und\"   \"Bye!\" \n\n\nA useful function in this context is paste(), which transforms and combines elements of several vectors:\n\nx &lt;- 1:10\ny &lt;- paste(\"Try nb.\", x)\ny\n\n [1] \"Try nb. 1\"  \"Try nb. 2\"  \"Try nb. 3\"  \"Try nb. 4\"  \"Try nb. 5\" \n [6] \"Try nb. 6\"  \"Try nb. 7\"  \"Try nb. 8\"  \"Try nb. 9\"  \"Try nb. 10\"\n\n\nThe function paste() also accepts an optional argument sep, which allows us to specify a token that should be placed between the elements to be combined (the default is sep=\" \"):\n\nday_nr &lt;- 1:10\nx_axis &lt;- paste(\"Day\", day_nr, sep = \": \")\nx_axis\n\n [1] \"Day: 1\"  \"Day: 2\"  \"Day: 3\"  \"Day: 4\"  \"Day: 5\"  \"Day: 6\"  \"Day: 7\" \n [8] \"Day: 8\"  \"Day: 9\"  \"Day: 10\"\n\n\n\n*Note**: Here we have an example of what is called ‚Äòrecycling‚Äô. since the vector c(\"Day\") was shorter than the vector day_nr, c(\"Day\") is simply copied so that the operation with paste() makes sense. Recycling is useful, but sometimes it can be harmful, namely when you think that you are using two vectors of the same length, but this is actually not the case. In such a case recycling leads to the fact that no error message is printed and the fact that the two vectors are not of the same length remains unnoticed An example of this is the following code, in which the intention is clearly to connect all weekdays to numbers and one weekday was simply forgotten:\n\n\ndays &lt;- paste(\"Tag \", 1:7, \":\", sep=\"\")\nday_names &lt;- c(\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\")\npaste(days, day_names)\n\n[1] \"Tag 1: Monday\"    \"Tag 2: Tuesday\"   \"Tag 3: Wednesday\" \"Tag 4: Thursday\" \n[5] \"Tag 5: Friday\"    \"Tag 6: Saturday\"  \"Tag 7: Monday\"   \n\n\n\n\nMissing values and NULL\nAs indicated above, missing values are encoded as NA. This is particularly useful in statistical contexts, where are particular element of a vector cannot simply be removed if it is unavailable.\n\nExample: The vector x contains a logical value that indicates whether a person has correctly answered the question on a questionnaire. If the person did not answer the third question on the questionnaire, this should be indicated by NA. Simply omitting the value makes it impossible to determine afterwards which question the person did not answer.\n\nMost operations that get NA as an input will also give NA as an output, because it is unclear what the result of the operation would be for different values for for the missing value:\n\n5 + NA\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThe only exception is an operation that yields a certain value completely independent from what you would substitute for NA:\n\nNA | TRUE # Always TRUE, no matter what you substitute for NA\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nTo test whether a vector x contains missing values you should always use the function is.na, never x==NA:\n\nx &lt;- c(NA, 5, NA, 10)\nprint(x == NA) # Unclear since not clear whether all NA must stand for the same value\n\n[1] NA NA NA NA\n\nprint(\n  is.na(x)\n)\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nWhenever an operation yields a value that cannot be defined, the result is not NA but NaN (not a number):\n\n0 / 0\n\n[1] NaN\n\n\nAnother special element is NULL. NULL is in fact a data type in itself (i.e.¬†it is not a vector), but in practice its best thought of as a vector of length zero:\n\nx &lt;- NULL\nlength(x)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nNULL is frequently used to indicate that something does not exist. An empty vector, for instance, is NULL:\n\nx &lt;- c()\nx\n\nNULL\n\nlength(x)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nThis is different to a vector with one (or more) missing elements:\n\ny &lt;- NA\nlength(y)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nWhen you define your own functions, you might use NULL as the default value for optional arguments. We will learn about such more advanced strategies later in this course. For now, its best to think of NULL as an vector of length zero.\n\n\nIndexing and replacement\nWe can extract single elements of a vector using squared brackets:\n\nx &lt;- c(2,4,6)\nx[1]\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nThis also allows us to modify specific elements:\n\nx &lt;- c(2,4,6)\nx[2] &lt;- 99\nx\n\n[1]  2 99  6\n\n\nBut we can also extract more than one element:\n\nx[1:2]\n\n[1]  2 99\n\n\nNegative indices eliminate the respective elements:\n\nx[-1]\n\n[1] 99  6\n\n\nTo get the last element of a vector you might combine this idea with the function length():\n\nx[length(x)]\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\n\nUseful functions when working with atomic vectors\nHere we shall mention a few functions that are particularly useful in the context of atomic vectors,9 especially when it comes to producing such vectors or to perform arithmetic operations with them.\nCreating atomic vectors:\nA sequence of whole numbers is something that we use very frequently. To create such sequences, the shortcut : comes in handy:\n\nx &lt;- 1:10\nx\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\n\ny &lt;- 10:1\ny\n\n [1] 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1\n\n\nTo build more complex sequences we can use seq(), which in its simplest case is equivalent to ::\n\nx &lt;- seq(1, 10)\nprint(x)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nThe function seq(), however, allows for a number of useful optional arguments. For instance, by allows us to control the space between the numbers:\n\ny &lt;- seq(1, 10, by = 0.5)\nprint(y)\n\n [1]  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  3.5  4.0  4.5  5.0  5.5  6.0  6.5  7.0  7.5  8.0\n[16]  8.5  9.0  9.5 10.0\n\n\nIf we want to specify the desired length of the resulting vector and let R choose the necessary space between the elements, we may use length.out:\n\nz &lt;- seq(2, 8, length.out = 4)\nprint(z)\n\n[1] 2 4 6 8\n\n\nAnd if we want to create a vector with the length as another vector, the argument along.with comes in handy. This is often used for creating index vectors.10 In such a case we do not have to specify the index numbers directly:\n\nz_index &lt;- seq(along.with = z)\nprint(z_index)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nAnother common task is to repeat a certain vector. This can be done with rep():\n\nx &lt;- rep(NA, 5)\nprint(x)\n\n[1] NA NA NA NA NA\n\n\nOperations\nThere are a number of operations that we use very frequently together with vectors. Often we are interested in the length of a vector. For this we can use the function length():\n\nx &lt;- c(1,2,3,4)\nlength(x)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nIf we are looking for the largest and smallest value of a vector we can use min() and max():\n\nmin(x)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\nmax(x)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nBoth functions (and many more similar functions) have the optional argument na.rm, which can be either TRUE or FALSE. In the case of TRUE, all NA values are removed before the operation gets applied:\n\ny &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,NA)\nmin(y)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\nmin(y, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nThe mean or the variance/standard deviation of the elements can be computed with mean(), var(), and sd(), all of which have also the optional argumentna.rm:\n\nmean(x)\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n\n\nvar(y)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\nvar(y, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 1.666667\n\n\nFinally, we often want to compute the sum or the product of all the elements of the vector. Here the functions sum() and prod() are useful:\n\nsum(x)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\nprod(y, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 24"

We create lists via the function list():\n\nl_1 &lt;- list(\n  \"a\",\n  c(1,2,3),\n  FALSE\n)\ntypeof(l_1)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\n\nl_1\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"a\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n[[3]]\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nLists can become very complex. The function str() (short for ‚Äústructure‚Äù) helps us to get a quick overview over a list and its elements:\n\nstr(l_1)\n\nList of 3\n $ : chr \"a\"\n $ : num [1:3] 1 2 3\n $ : logi FALSE\n\n\nWe can name the elements of lists:11\n\nl_2 &lt;- list(\n  \"first_element\" = \"a\",\n  \"second_element\" = c(1,2,3),\n  \"third_element\" = FALSE\n)\n\nWe can retrieve the names of all elements of the list with names():\n\nnames(l_2)\n\n[1] \"first_element\"  \"second_element\" \"third_element\" \n\n\nThere are two very important differences in the handling of vectors and lists:\n\nVectorization does not work for lists\nIndexing works differently\n\nThe first issue can be illustrated easily:\n\nvec_expl &lt;- c(1,2,3)\nlist_expl &lt;- list(1,2,3)\nsqrt(vec_expl)\n\n[1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051\n\n\nBut:\n\nsqrt(list_expl)\n\nError in sqrt(list_expl): non-numeric argument to mathematical function\n\n\nThe second issue is due to the more complex structure of lists. For vectors we extracted single elements via [. For lists, there is a difference between [ and [[. The former always returns a list:\n\nl_1[2]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nThe second then returns a vector and is more similar to the behavior of [ in the context of atomic vectors:\n\nl_1[[2]]\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nTo extract an element of this vector we can chain the brackets:\n\nl_1[[2]][3]\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe can also extract elements by their name:\n\nl_2[[1]]\n\n[1] \"a\"\n\n\n\nl_2[[\"first_element\"]]\n\n[1] \"a\"\n\n\nLists are fundamental to many more complex structures that we will encounter later. They are more flexible than atomic vectors, but this flexibility also makes them more difficult to use and less efficient for tasks where this flexibility is not needed. As a rule of thumb, whenever you can represent something as an atomic vector, you should do so. You should always have a good reason for using lists!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the previous posts you learned about the most important fundamental data types in R. The types we will learn about below and not less important, but less fundamental. This means they are built by taking one of the base types we encountered before, and ‚Äòadding some features‚Äô. These features change the behavior of the type, e.g.m how it is printed or how it is affected by certain function calls, but also what kind of operations it allows.1\nThis process of ‚Äòadding features‚Äô is usually done by adding ‚Äòattributes‚Äô to an object. In principle, you can add attributes to any objects without much effect by using the attr() function:\n\nx &lt;- 2.0\nattr(x, \"Mood\") &lt;- \"Haha!\"\n\nTo retrieve attributes use attributes():\n\nattributes(x)\n\n$Mood\n[1] \"Haha!\"\n\n\nSometimes, adding attributes of a particular name have more relevant implications. One useful way to use attributes, for instance, is to name the single elements of vectors, something that changes the way the objects are printed and something that we already discussed in the context of lists:\n\ny &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nattr(y, \"names\") &lt;- c(\"First\", \"Second\", \"Third\")\ny\n\n First Second  Third \n     1      2      3 \n\n\n\nattributes(y)\n\n$names\n[1] \"First\"  \"Second\" \"Third\" \n\n\nNow we can call elements by their name:\n\ny[\"Second\"]\n\nSecond \n     2 \n\n\nBut things become really interesting if you add an attribute called class: this really transforms the data types into a new, less fundamental type. In fact, this is how the types we discuss below, are created: smart people added, among other things, a class attribute to a more fundamental data type (integer in the case of factors and list in the case of data.frames). The art of writing new classes is part of object oriented programming, an advanced concept that we do not cover in this course (and, to be honest, one of the areas where R is not particularly well designed).\nOne implication of this ‚Äòless fundamental‚Äô nature of the objects we encounter below is that typeof() usually returns the base type. For instance, below we will learn about the factor, a type that is built upon integer. If we call typeof() on a factor, it will return the fundamental type, i.e.¬†integer:\n\nxx &lt;- factor(c(1,2))\ntypeof(xx)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nFortunately, the standard test functions (is.*()) usually work, so you can use is.factor():\n\nis.factor(xx)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nAlternatively, you can always inspect that attributes of the object to find out about its class:\n\nattributes(xx)\n\n$levels\n[1] \"1\" \"2\"\n\n$class\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n\nAll this can be confusing at first, so it is important to keep it in mind. Once you wrapped your head upon this, many confusing behaviors suddenly start to make sense, e.g.¬†that mutating factors within a data.frame can result in whole numbers, a phenomenon we will discuss in the context of data wrangling later."

    "text": "When learning a programming language, applying the new concepts regularly is absolutely essential. Without regular practice it is hard to impossible to remember everything you need to actually enjoy working with R.\nTherefore, I prepared a small set of exercises for each session that I recommend you to do after the session. This will help you to remember what you have learned and to find out what you did not understand well. I then urge you to post your problems on Moodle, to ask your colleagues and to help each other out. This will be a great boost to your learning progress: explaining something to others is not only great in a normative sense, it also helps you to get a deeper understanding of the concepts yourself.\nIn this short post I quickly explain how you can use the exercises that I have prepared for you. For those of you interested in the underlying mechanics: all exercises were prepared using the package learnr together with the gradethis package, and are distributed in the package DataScienceExercises.\nTo use the exercises you must have installed the packages learnr, gradethis and DataScienceExercises. If you followed the instructions in the tutorial on installing R packages this should be the case. If for some reasons you need to install them, you can do this via:\n\npack_names &lt;- c(\n  \"rstudio/learnr\",\n  \"rstudio/gradethis\",\n  \"graebnerc/DataScienceExercises\"\n)\nremotes::install_github(\n  repo = pack_names, upgrade = \"always\")\n\nNote that this requires a previous installation of the package remotes:\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\n\nSince I update the exercises according to your feedback, and add new exercises over the semester, I strongly recommend you to update the package DataScienceExercises each time before you start practicing. To do so you need an internet connection. If you just want to do the exercises without updating the package, an internet connection is not required: the exercises themselves also work offline.\nTo update the package, simply type the following into the console and press Enter:\n\nremotes::install_github(\n  repo = \"graebnerc/DataScienceExercises\", upgrade = \"always\")\n\nThis should update your package version to the most recent release.\nIf you want to start an exercise you first need to figure out the name of the exercise sheet. This is provided in the Material section of the course webpage. Then you call execute the following code via the console in R Studio, replacing ‚ÄòEX_NAME‚Äô with the name of the exercise sheet:\n\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\n  name = \"EX_NAME\", \n  package = \"DataScienceExercises\", \n  shiny_args=list(\"launch.browser\"=TRUE))\n\nThe first exercise sheet, for instance, is called Basics. Thus, to call it execute the following:\n\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\n  name = \"Basics\", \n  package = \"DataScienceExercises\", \n  shiny_args=list(\"launch.browser\"=TRUE))\n\nLastly, if you encounter a bug or a mistake, or have an idea for a good exercise, please let me know via the issue tracker of the DataScienceExercises package or via Moodle.

We now go through each step that, in the end, will produce the following plot:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe start by creating the basic ggplot2 object, which is best thought of as a fancy list. To this end we use the function ggplot2::ggplot()\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot()\ntypeof(gdp_plot)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nWhen we call this list, the plot described by it gets rendered:\n\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nOf, course, there is no plot since the list is basically empty. All the specifications in the ggplot2::ggplot() function are best thought of as default values. In our case we fist specify the data set we use for our plot:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(\n  data = gdp_data\n)\n\nBut this alone does not do anything good. We also need to inform ggplot2 on how it should map the variables from the data set onto the plot. In a first step, lets clarify that the variable gdpPercap should be mapped on the x-axis and the variable lifeExp on the y-axis.\nThis is done via the argument mapping and the function ggplot2::aes(), which takes as arguments the aesthetics of the plot and the variable names that should be plotted on them:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(\n  data = gdp_data, \n  mapping = ggplot2::aes(\n    x = gdpPercap,\n    y = lifeExp\n  )\n)\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nThis looks better. Note that ggplot2 chooses a default range for the axes based on the range of the variables in the underlying data set:\n\nmin(gdp_data$lifeExp); max(gdp_data$lifeExp)\n\n[1] 39.613\n\n\n[1] 82.603\n\nmin(gdp_data$gdpPercap); max(gdp_data$gdpPercap)\n\n[1] 277.5519\n\n\n[1] 49357.19\n\n\nWe now want to add an additional layer with data points on our plot. Poits are so called geom: a certain geometrical object representing data points. The function to add points is called ggplot2::geom_point() amd we literally just add it to our plot:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot + geom_point()\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nThis already reveals much of the general workflow involved in creating a plot: define a raw object and add and refine layers. Looking at the plot above, one thing that is missing is that the dots are filled in different colors, representing the continents of the countries, and the size of the dots represent the population size of the countries.\nTo achieve this we need to map the variable continent from the data set to the aesthetic color in the plot, and the variable pop to the aesthetic size:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(\n  data = gdp_data, \n  mapping = ggplot2::aes(\n    x = gdpPercap,\n    y = lifeExp,\n    size = pop, \n    color = continent\n    )\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point()\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nWhat is not so nice is that the points are partly overlapping and bigger points might conceal smaller points below them. To address this problem we might make the plots a bit transparent. Since this is not a mapping from a variable from the data set to an aesthetic, but a general setting that should apply to all points equally, we do not specify it via the argument aes, but via the parameter responsible for transparency directly. This parameter is called alpha and we can set it for the affected geom directly:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(\n  data = gdp_data, \n  mapping = ggplot2::aes(\n    x = gdpPercap,\n    y = lifeExp,\n    size = pop, \n    color = continent\n    )\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point(alpha=0.5)\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nBut now there is the danger for points to ‚Äòmelt into each other‚Äô. Better have their circle in black, and only color their interior. We can do so by replacing color in the aesthetics with fill, and set the color explicitly to 'black'. However, this distinction between circle color and fill color is not available for all kind of point shapes. You need to search the internet for a shape that supports this distinction. If you looked, for instance, here you found that they shape with index 21 allows this:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(\n  data = gdp_data, \n  mapping = ggplot2::aes(\n    x = gdpPercap,\n    y = lifeExp,\n    size = pop, \n    fill = continent\n    )\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point(\n    shape=21, color=\"black\", alpha=0.5)\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nProgress cannot be denied! Now lets fix the labels and annotations of the plot. Here, the function ggplot2::labs() comes in handy. It accepts arguments such as title, subtitle, captio, and several more. The help() function gives further information about the possibilities.\nIn our case we want to add a title, specify the x and y axis, and add a caption:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Life expectancy and income per capita\", \n    caption = \"Note: size of bubbles represents population. Data: Gapminder\",\n    x = \"GDP per capita (int. Dollar)\",\n    y = \"Life expectancy in years\"\n  )\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nSo far, so good. The x-axis is a bit clumsy, though. It would be better to scale the number down so that it shows 1000 dollars. The scale properties of the axes can be defined by the functions scale_*_**(), where the first * should be replaced by the aesthetic we want to adjust, and the second by a keyword indicating whether the variable is discrete or continuous, or whether we want to provide fully manual specifications. In our case we are interested in changing the x-axis, which represents a continuous variable (GDP). Thus we call scale_x_continuous(). Since we want to change the labels on the axis we specify the argument labels. To scale the labels we make use of a function from the scales-package: scales::number_format(). And to make this clear on the axis we add the suffix ‚Äòk‚Äô:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot +\n  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(\n    labels = scales::number_format(scale = 0.001, suffix = \"k\")\n    )\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nNow lets turn to the legends. First of all we want to remove the legend for the bubble size since, first, the mapping of the bubble size is not straightforward to understand and, second, we already indicated that the bubble size represents population in the caption of the plot. There are several ways to to this: either we use the scale_*_*() function we already encountered with the argument guide=\"none\":\n\ngdp_plot + ggplot2::scale_size_continuous(guide = \"none\")\n\nOr we use a function that allows us to specify all kinds of legend properties: ggplot2::guides(). Here we take the aesthetic name as an argument and set it to ¬¥‚Äúnone‚Äù`:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot + ggplot2::guides(size = \"none\")\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage of using ggplot2::scale_size_continuous() would be that we could strech the limits a bit to make the differences more straightforward to see:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot + \n  ggplot2::scale_size_continuous(\n    guide = \"none\", \n    range = c(0.1, 24)\n    )\n\nNow we want to put the remaining legend to the bottom of the plot. Again, there are several ways to achieve this, but for such specific changes the function ggplot2::theme() is usually a good option. It allows us to change almost everything on a plot. The argument to place legends at the bottom is legend.position and already hints at the internal logic of theme(), which you might explore through the help() function yourself:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot +\n  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nSince the theme() function is so extensive there are also many pre-defined themes for plots, which are best explored in the internet. A good default one is the black-and-white theme, which we can use via ggplot2::theme_bw():\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot +\n  ggplot2::theme_bw()\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nOups, while everything looks nicer, some of our previous changes, such as moving the legend to the bottom and removing its title were overwritten! It, thus, makes always sense to first call the default theme, and then make further changes via ggplot::theme().\nOf course, we can then also make further adjustments to the theme, e.g.¬† by removing the panel of the plot. Removing elements of the plot via ggplot2::theme() requires us to set these elements via the function ggplot2::element_blank():\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot +\n  ggplot2::theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.border = ggplot2::element_blank()\n  )\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nHm, but it would indeed be a bit nicer to keep the axis lines of the x- and y-axis. Lets do this by specifying them explicitly via ggplot2::element_line(), which again allows for endless specification details:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot +\n  ggplot2::theme(\n    axis.line = ggplot2::element_line(colour = \"grey\"))\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nIts time to get picky! The ticks of the values should have the same color as the axis lines!!!\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot +\n  ggplot2::theme(\n    axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_line(colour = \"grey\"))\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nOkay, you should get the general idea. What is more worrisome, to be honest, is the ugly title of the legend. Away with it!\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot +\n  ggplot2::theme(legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank())\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nSo, the only thing that distinguishes our plot from the initial example is the color pallette. There are many different pallettes available, you can search for your favorite one in the internet. Here we use one provided by the package RColorBrewer, which can be used for the fill-aesthetic direclty:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- gdp_plot +\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\")\ngdp_plot\n\n\n\n\nThats it! This was, of course, only a tiny glimpse on what you can achieve using ggplot2, but it should suffice for the start. Moreover, what is more important, you learned about the general workflow when developing a plot: start with creating a list with ¬¥ggplot2::ggplot()` and then adjust your plot layer by layer until you are satisfied.\nHere is the whole code we used for the figure:\n\ngdp_plot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(\n  data = gdp_data, \n  mapping = ggplot2::aes(\n    x = gdpPercap,\n    y = lifeExp,\n    size = pop, \n    fill = continent\n  )\n) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point(\n    shape=21, color=\"black\", alpha=0.5) +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Life expectancy and income per capita\", \n    caption = \"Note: size of bubbles represents population. Data: Gapminder\",\n    x = \"GDP per capita (int. Dollar)\",\n    y = \"Life expectancy in years\"\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(\n    labels = scales::number_format(scale = 0.001, suffix = \"k\")\n  ) + \n  ggplot2::scale_size_continuous(\n    guide = \"none\", \n    range = c(0.1, 24)\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(\n    palette = \"Dark2\"\n    ) +\n  ggplot2::theme_bw() +\n  ggplot2::theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank(),\n    panel.border = ggplot2::element_blank(),\n    axis.line = ggplot2::element_line(colour = \"grey\"),\n    axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_line(colour = \"grey\")\n  )\n\nOf course, for simple exploratory analysis, you do not need so many details as we just did, but for publication purposes its good to know how far you can get!\nAnother great thing is that the syntax remains largely the same, no matter whether you want to make a scatter plot as above, or a line graph or a histogram. All that changes is the particular geom_*() function used.\n\n\nAn alternativ line plot\nTo illustrate the similarities of the code used for a different plot type, we will now use a data set that is very similar to the one used previously, only this time we have observations for GDP per capita and life expectancy for several years, aggregated for the different continents. The data set is gain made available via the package DataScienceExercises:\n\ngdp_data_agg &lt;- DataScienceExercises::aggGDPlifexp\n\nAgain, we first inspect the data to get a feeling about the variables that are present:\n\nhead(gdp_data_agg, 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 5\n  continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Africa     1952    39.1 4570010.     1253.\n2 Africa     1957    41.3 5093033.     1385.\n3 Africa     1962    43.3 5702247.     1598.\n\n\nLets plot the dynamics of GDP per capita over time for the different continents. We can now simply copy-paste a lot of the code we have used before. Lets start with the uncontroversial beginning and just replace the name of the data set and the variable names:\n\ngdp_dyn_plot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(\n  data = gdp_data_agg, # &lt;- Replaced \n  mapping = ggplot2::aes(\n    x = year, # &lt;- Replaced \n    y = gdpPercap, # &lt;- Replaced \n    color = continent#, \n    #fill = continent # &lt;- Not necessary \n  )\n) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point() \ngdp_dyn_plot\n\n\n\n\nThis is not so bad! But it would be nice to add an additional geom that connects the dots with lines. No problem, simply add ggplot2::geom_line() to the plot:\n\ngdp_dyn_plot &lt;- gdp_dyn_plot +\n  geom_line()\ngdp_dyn_plot\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the code above only requires slight adjustments: the scaling of the x-axis should now be applied to the y-axis so we change ggplot2::scale_x_continuous() into ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(). Moreover, colors should change not for the fill but the color aesthetic, so ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer() becomes ggplot2::scale_color_brewer():\n\ngdp_dyn_plot &lt;- gdp_dyn_plot +\n  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = scales::number_format(scale = 0.001, suffix = \"k\")\n  ) + \n  ggplot2::scale_color_brewer(\n    palette = \"Dark2\"\n    )\ngdp_dyn_plot\n\n\n\n\nAside from this, we can pretty much re-use almost the entire code from above with which we adjusted the legend, the labels, as well as the overall theme, only we can be so bold to remove the title of the x-axis via axis.title.x = ggplot2::element_blank(). Moreover, since we do not map the population size, ggplot2::scale_size_continuous() can now be removed, resulting in:\n\ngdp_dyn_plot &lt;- gdp_dyn_plot +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The divergence of income per capita\", \n    caption = \"Note: country data averaged over continants. Data: Gapminder\",\n    y = \"GDP per capita (int. Dollar)\"\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank(),\n    panel.border = ggplot2::element_blank(),\n    axis.line = ggplot2::element_line(colour = \"grey\"),\n    axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_line(colour = \"grey\"),\n    axis.title.x = ggplot2::element_blank()\n  )\ngdp_dyn_plot\n\n\n\n\nAgain, a very nice plot - and much faster to complete than the first one, thanks to the amazingly consistent syntax of ggplot2:)\n\n\nSaving your plot\nYou can save your plot using the function ggplot2::ggsave(). The function saves, by default, the last plot you created, but it is better to specify the plot you want to save directly. Other important arguments are the file name (which also determines the format), and the size:\n\nggplot2::ggsave(\n  plot = gdp_plot, \n  filename = \"gdp_plot.pdf\", \n  width = 6, height = 4.2)"

Inside the parentheses we can specify the arguments of the function. Most of the time, the first argument(s) are the input(s).\nOften, you can give more arguments to the function. These specify how the algorithm of the function works. If you are not sure which arguments a function accepts, you can always use help().\nLet us consider the example of mean().
