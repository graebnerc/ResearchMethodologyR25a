As with its\npredecessor, the idea is to provide people with the opportunity to write \ntext and code into the very same document. This makes the creation of nice\nlooking and reproducible reports or paper very easy. Moreoever, with Quarto\nit is very easy to create very nice papers, reports, websites or interactive\napps. This website, for example, is fully written in Quarto. In this lecture,\nyou learn everything you need to get started with writing your first Quarto \ndocuments. In fact, its really straightforward once you get the basic idea.\n\n\n## 👨‍🏫 Lecture Slides \n\nEither click on the slide area below or click \n[here](/content/material/slides/E9-Quarto.pdf) to download the slides.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n  <iframe \n  src=\"/content/material/slides/E9-Quarto.pdf\" \n  style=\"border: 0.5px\" \n  width=\"80%\"\n  height=\"80%\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div>\n```\n\n- [DesasterMarkdown.pdf](DesasterMarkdown.pdf)\n- [NicerMarkdown.pdf](NicerMarkdown.pdf)\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code for the markdown desaster and a possible solution\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/graebnerc/44b82add84b1d5cb89d28574ae89ed02.js\"></script>\n\n:::\n\n\n## 🎥 Lecture videos \n\nSo far, there are no learning videos available for this lecture. \n\n## 📚 Mandatory Reading\n\n- [The CommonMark markdown tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)\n- [Quarto tutorial I: the basics](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)\n- [Quarto tutorial II: computations](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/computations/rstudio.html)\n- [Quarto tutorial III: authoring quarto documents](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/rstudio.html)\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [Blog introducing Quarto](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/)\n- [Quarto and R Markdown](https://yihui.org/en/2022/04/quarto-r-markdown/)\n- [The comprehensive Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)\n- [Markdown basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)\n- [The R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)\n\n## ✍️ Coursework\n\n- Do the exercises `Quarto` from the `DataScienceExercises` package\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Quick code for starting the exercises\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\n  name = \"Quarto\", \n  package = \"DataScienceExercises\", \n  shiny_args=list(\"launch.browser\"=TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n- Do the following practical exercise:\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Exercise description\n\nCreate a new Quarto document where you set the title, date, and the author explicitly. Write a sample text that comprises…\n\n- ...at least one level 1 heading\n- ...at least two level 2 headings\n- ...a YAML part that specifies that R code remains hidden by default\n- ...one R chunk where both the output and the code is printed in the final document\n- ...one R chunk that produces a simply ggplot object and where the code producing the plot is hidden\n\nThen do the following:\n\n1. Knit the document to html with a floating table of contents and a special theme.\n2. Make the document available via Netlify Drop and add the possibility to download the underlying Rmd file. \n> Note: For Netlify Drop to work, the html file must be called `index.html```!\n\n3. Knit the document to PDF and make sure that it includes a table of contents.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Possible solution\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/graebnerc/f42962b9ecbf9d7a7e6dc5593be691bd.js\"></script>\n\n:::\n",
