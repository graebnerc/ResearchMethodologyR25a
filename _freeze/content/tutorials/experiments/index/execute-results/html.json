We will\ncomplement the lecture by also introducing some additional, practically relevant\nconcepts.\n\nMore precisely, we focus on the following aspects:\n\n- Import and explore datasets as typically produced by experiments\n- Conduct t-tests for simple experimental comparisons\n- Perform ANOVA for multi-group comparisons\n- Understand how ANOVA is a special case of linear regression\n- Analyze factorial experimental designs\n- Calculate and interpret effect sizes\n- Create visualizations of experimental results\n\nThroughout the tutorial we will use the following packages:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)        # Data manipulation\nlibrary(ggplot2)      # Data visualization\nlibrary(ggdist)       # More visualization options\nlibrary(readr)        # Simple data import\nlibrary(broom)        # Extract model data\nlibrary(effectsize)   # Effect size calculations\nlibrary(car)          # Advanced ANOVA functions\nlibrary(emmeans)      # Post-hoc comparisons\nlibrary(knitr)        # For nice tables\nlibrary(kableExtra)   # For enhanced table formatting\nlibrary(patchwork)    # For aligning multiple plots\nlibrary(pwr)          # For power analysis and sample size planning\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will use the following data sets, which are available for download from the\nlab webpage.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nleadership_study_between <- read_csv(\n  file = \"leadership_study_between.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nleadership_study_within <- read_csv(\n  file = \"leadership_study_within.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\ncommunication_study <- read_csv(\n  file = \"communication_study.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nfactorial_study <- read_csv(\n  file = \"factorial_study.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor each main analysis tool - t-test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA - there are\na number of steps to be taken:\n\n1. Get an exploratory overview over the data\n2. Check the assumptions of the analysis tool\n3. Implement the analysis tool\n4. Calculate standardized effect sizes\n5. Conduct post-hoc tests, if necessary\n\nSince the commands are basically the same for all tools, we discuss these steps\nmore extensively in the beginning when dealing with t-tests, and only provide\nexample code later on.\n\n# The data used\n\nAs usual, it is a good idea to start with looking at the data sets, such that you know what the data looks like:^[I use the function `kable()` for nicer output in the html file. \nWhen you replicate the code in R-Studio its best to skip the part `|> kable()`.]\n\n## The between leadership study\n\nResults of an experiment where the treatment group has received leadership training, and the control group did not. Both groups participated in an exercise where their performance was assessed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(leadership_study_between) |> \n  kable()\n```\n\n:::

|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**💡 Short recap**: How have these data sets been created? How do they connect to the experimental designs discussed in the lecture?\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Possible answers\" collapse=\"true\"} \n- **Dataset 1**: Classic randomized controlled trial (RCT) with treatment and control groups\n- **Dataset 2**: One-way experimental design with three conditions (between-subjects)\n- **Dataset 3**: 2×2 factorial design allowing us to test main effects and interactions\n- **Connection to lecture**: These represent the three main experimental designs we discussed - simple, multi-group, and factorial\n:::\n\n---\n\n# Part 2: Simple Experiments - t-tests\n\nAssume we are asking the following research question:\n\n> Does leadership training improve team performance?\n\nOne way to tackle this question is to compare a treatment group, which has received a leadership training, to a control group, which has not received such training. If the groups are otherwise similar, then this setting should help us to identify the causal effect of the leadership training.^[At this point we assume that the groups were similar before the training. In practice, it would be good to first make sure the performances of the groups before the training were similar.]\n\n## Descriptive statistics\n\nFor this task, we will use the first data set.\nLet us first compute the standard statistics:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndescriptive_stats <- leadership_study_between %>%\n  group_by(group) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n = n(),\n    mean = mean(team_performance),\n    sd = sd(team_performance),\n    median = median(team_performance),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\n\nkable(descriptive_stats, digits = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|group    |  n|  mean|   sd| median|\n|:--------|--:|-----:|----:|------:|\n|control  | 30| 74.53| 9.81|  74.26|\n|training | 30| 83.78| 8.35|  82.48|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs usual, it is also strongly recommended to complement the quantitative info with a visualization.\nData such as those is often presented using boxplots:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(leadership_study_between, aes(x = group, y = team_performance, fill = group)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", shape = 23, size = 3, fill = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Team Performance by Group\",\n       x = \"Group\",\n       y = \"Team Performance Score\",\n       caption = \"Red diamonds show group means\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut boxplots might shallow important distributional info, so you should use them carefully or complement them with other tools. Below is an alternative that provides more information on the distribution of the data.\nFor more on this issue see @Holtz_2025.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  data = leadership_study_between, \n  mapping = aes(x = group, y = team_performance, fill = group)\n  ) +\n    stat_halfeye(\n    adjust = 0.5,\n    justification = -0.2,\n    .width = 0,\n    point_colour = NA\n  ) +\n  geom_boxplot(\n    width = 0.12,\n    outlier.color = NA,\n    alpha = 0.5\n  ) +\n  stat_dots(\n    side = \"left\",\n    justification = 1.1,\n    binwidth = 0.85\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The effect of leadership training\",\n    y = \"Team performance\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank()\n  ) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Assumption Checking\n\nIn the following we want to compare the means across independent groups.\nTo this end, we may use a t-test. \n\nBut such statistical tests make specific assumptions about the data. If these assumptions were violated, the results would be unreliable or incorrect. \nTherefore, it is important to check the adequacy of these assumptions for the data at hand first.\n\nAnd no worries if the assumptions for one test are violated - usually there are alternatives available.\n\nIn the present case, we want to use a simple t-test. This test makes two assumptions:\n\n1. The two groups each are normally distributed.\n2. The variances of both groups are the same. \n\nTo test the first assumption, we can use the **Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality**.\nHere we test the following hypothesis:\n\n- $H_0$ : The data is normally distributed\n- $H_1$ : The data is not normally distributed  \n\nThus, we we get $p > 0.05$, we cannot reject $H_0$. But for smaller $p$-values,\nwe should reject $H_0$ and need to look for alternatives to the standard t-test.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nleadership_study_between |> \n  filter(group==\"control\") |> \n  pull(team_performance) |> \n  shapiro.test()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tShapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  pull(filter(leadership_study_between, group == \"control\"), team_performance)\nW = 0.97894, p-value = 0.7966\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nleadership_study_between |> \n  filter(group==\"training\") |> \n  pull(team_performance) |> \n  shapiro.test()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tShapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  pull(filter(leadership_study_between, group == \"training\"), team_performance)\nW = 0.98662, p-value = 0.9614\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGood!

**Power**: Probability of detecting effect (usually we want ≥ 0.8)\n- **Effect size**: How big a difference we want to detect\n- **Sample size**: Number of participants needed\n- **Alpha level**: Type I error rate (usually 0.05)\n\nWe can use power analysis in two different ways:\n\n1. **Post-hoc (observed)**: What was our power given the sample size we had?\n2. **A priori (prospective)**: How many participants do we need to detect an effect?\n\nRegarding the first, we may ask: \nwhat was our power to detect the effect we found in the leadership study?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

need to specify your research parameters:\n\n- What effect size do you want to detect?\n- What power level do you want? (typically 0.8 or 0.9)\n- What alpha level will you use?
