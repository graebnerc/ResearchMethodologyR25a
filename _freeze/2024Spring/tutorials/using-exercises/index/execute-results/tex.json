Without regular practice it is hard to impossible\nto remember everything you need to actually enjoy working with `R`.\n\nTherefore, I prepared a small set of exercises for each session that I \nrecommend you to do after the session. This will help you to remember what \nyou have learned and to find out what you did not understand well. I then urge\nyou to post your problems on Moodle, to ask your colleagues and to help each\nother out. This will be a great boost to your learning progress: \nexplaining something to others is not only great in a normative sense, it also\nhelps you to get a deeper understanding of the concepts yourself.\n\nIn this short post I quickly explain how you can use the exercises that I have\nprepared for you. For those of you interested in the underlying mechanics:\nall exercises were prepared using the package \n[learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) together with\nthe [gradethis](https://github.com/rstudio/gradethis) package, \nand are distributed in the package `DataScienceExercises`.\n\nTo use the exercises you must have installed the packages `learnr`, `gradethis`\nand `DataScienceExercises`. If you followed the instructions in the tutorial on \n[installing R packages](/tutorial/installing-packages/) this should be the case. \nIf for some reasons you need to install them, you can do this via:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npack_names <- c(\n  \"rstudio/learnr\",\n  \"rstudio/gradethis\",\n  \"graebnerc/DataScienceExercises\"\n)\nremotes::install_github(\n  repo = pack_names, upgrade = \"always\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that this requires a previous installation of the package `remotes`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nSince I update the exercises according to your feedback, and add new \nexercises over the semester, I strongly recommend you to update the package\n`DataScienceExercises` each time before you start practicing.\nTo do so you need an internet \nconnection. If you just want to *do* the exercises without updating the \npackage, an internet connection is *not* required: the exercises themselves\nalso work offline.\n\nTo update the package, simply type the following into the console and press\n`Enter`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nremotes::install_github(\n  repo = \"graebnerc/DataScienceExercises\", upgrade = \"always\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis should update your package version to the most recent release.\n\nIf you want to start an exercise you first need to figure out the name of the\nexercise sheet. This is provided in the [Material section](/material/) \nof the course webpage. \nThen you call execute the following code via the console in R Studio,\nreplacing 'EX_NAME' with the name of the exercise sheet:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\n  name = \"EX_NAME\", \n  package = \"DataScienceExercises\", \n  shiny_args=list(\"launch.browser\"=TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe first exercise sheet, for instance, is called `Basics`. Thus, to call it\nexecute the following:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\n  name = \"Basics\", \n  package = \"DataScienceExercises\", \n  shiny_args=list(\"launch.browser\"=TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLastly, if you encounter a bug or a mistake, or have an idea for a good \nexercise, please let me know via the \n[issue tracker](https://github.com/graebnerc/DataScienceExercises/issues)\nof the `DataScienceExercises` package or via Moodle. Thank you!\n",
