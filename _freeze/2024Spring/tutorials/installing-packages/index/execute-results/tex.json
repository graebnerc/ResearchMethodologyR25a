This way you make sure that everything is working now, \nand you save yourself from trouble during the semester. Moreover, installing \nthese packages is necessary to do the exercises provided after each session.\n\nTo install packages, a stable internet connection is required. Then, proceed\nas follows:\n\n1. Download the script \n[install_packages_script.R](install_packages_script.R) and save it in a \ndirectory of your choice\n2. Open the file `install_packages_script.R` in R-Studio. To this end, \nright-click on the file and select `Open with`, and then choose R-Studio.\n3. Adjust the first line of the script to the OS you are using.\nFor instance, when you are using a Mac the file\nshould look like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](firstline-mac.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](firstline-win.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n4. Select lines 1-52 and click on the button `Run` (the screenshot only shows\nthe lines 42-52, the previous lines are also selected):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](clickrun.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n5. Check if the package `here` was installed. You will get the respective \nmessage in the console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](here-success.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please \nmake a screenshot and post it in the Moodle forum.\n6. Select the rest of the scrip and run it as you did with the first lines.\nIf you get the following message everything worked well and all packages\nwere installed successfully:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](package-success.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIf not, please post the file `InstallationLog.txt` and a screenshot with an \nerror into the Moodle forum.\n\nNote: maybe you will see the following message during the installation process\n(possible multiple times):\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](binary-available.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI recommend to type `No` and press enter. If, for any reason, the installation\nprocess is not successful you might run the installation commands again and \ntry responding with `Yes`, this might sometimes fix the problem.\n\n# Verify the usability of exercises\n\nIf everything worked well until here you should be able to access the \nexercise sheets that I provide you with after each session. To make sure \neverything works as expected, please run the following command in the console\nand press enter:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\n  name = \"Basics\", \n  package = \"DataScienceExercises\", \n  shiny_args=list(\"launch.browser\"=TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis means you type it like this and press enter:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exercise-enter.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIf the exercise window opens, everything is well, if not, please describe your\nproblem in the Moodle forum.\n\nAfter you closed the window and the process is still active, just click on the\n`Stop` button in R-Studio:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exercise-end.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAnd then click on the `Console` tab on the left to return to the console.\n\n# Installing LaTeX\n\nTo create PDF-documents you have to install a \n[Latex distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/).\nI recommend you to install the distribution\n[tinytex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/),\nno matter whether you already have a different distribution or not.\n\nI recommend installing tinytex via Quarto. You should have \ninstalled Quarto during\n[this tutorial](/tutorial/installation/), but in case you \ndid not, just follow the instructions on \n[this webpage](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).\n\nThen follow the instructions from [this tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html).\nWhat you essentially need to do is to open your terminal and issue\nthe following command:\n\n```\nquarto install tinytex\n```\n\nTo make sure everything runs smoothly you should download the document \n[test_pdf.qmd](test_pdf.qmd).\nTo test whether everything works, please open `test.Rmd` in R-Studio and then\nclick on the button `Render` \n(which is a couple of buttons left of `Run`).\n\nIf this works you are all set. If there are any errors showing up, please\npost a screenshot and a problem description to the Moodle forum.\n\n\n## A common problem when installing tinytex on a Mac\n\nThe following hints should be helpful if after the attempted installation\nof `tinytex` you see either one of these error messages:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tiny-error-1.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tiny-error-2.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn this case, execute the following comment in your R console within\nR-Studio:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntinytex::install_tinytex(force = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThen close R-Studio and restart your computer. If `test_pdf.qmd` still cannot be\ncompiled after this, please open your Mac Terminal (via the app `Terminal`)\nand enter the following commands:\n\n```\nsudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/bin\n\n~/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr path add\n```\nThen install `tinytex` again as described above, restart your computer, and\ntry to compile `test_pdf.qmd` again.\n\n\n",
