In this session you learn how\nto adequately set up your working environment on your computer. This means\nwhere you should save which files, which directory structure you should use,\nand how to point the computer to other files on your computer. While this sounds\nboring at first, taking seriously the insights from this session will save you\ntons of hours of frustration in the future!\n\n\n## 👨‍🏫 Lecture Slides \n\nEither click on the slide area below or click \n[here](/2024Spring/material/slides/T8-ProjectSetup.pdf) to download the slides.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n  <iframe \n  src=\"/2024Spring/material/slides/T8-ProjectSetup.pdf\" \n  style=\"border: 0.5px\" \n  width=\"80%\"\n  height=\"80%\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n## 🎥 Lecture videos \n\nCurrently, no videos are available for this session. Check out the tutorial\non \n[project setup](/2024Spring/tutorials/setting-up-an-r-project/index.qmd) \ninstead.\n\n## 📚 Mandatory Reading\n\n- The tutorial [Setting up an R project](/2024Spring/tutorials/setting-up-an-r-project/index.qmd)\n\n## Further Reading\n\nWhile we do not cover this in this course, I highly recommend learning the \nversion control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/). \nPersonally, I can recommend the following:\n\n- [Very concise introduction](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) to Git\n- Introduction to GitHub: [GitHub skills](https://skills.github.com/) and the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en)\n\n## ✍️ Coursework\n\n- Do the exercises `ProjectOrga` from the `DataScienceExercises` package that refer to setting up an R project\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Quick code for starting the exercises\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\n  name = \"ProjectOrga\", \n  package = \"DataScienceExercises\", \n  shiny_args=list(\"launch.browser\"=TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n",
