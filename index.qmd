# ðŸ“‘ The course in brief

**Focus:** 
This course is part of the module *Theoretical and Empirical Research Methodology*.
It complements the theoretical lectures by introducing you to the statistical 
programming language R and acquire practical knowledge about how to implement 
essential research tools and all theoretical concepts discussed during the 
main lecture in R. 

**How:** 
The implementation lab comprises a mixture of (i) lectures, in which I introduce concepts
in the classroom, (ii) automated hands-on exercises for you to do at home on
your own and (iii) instructional videos for topics that are best learned and
practiced by yourself. Of course, you are always invited to post your questions
to the course forum on Moodle and more intricate problems can be solved in class.

**Prerequisites:**
The lab does not require you to have any prior knowledge in R or any other 
programming language. Depending on your prior knowledge or affinity to 
programming, the course will be quite demanding, but equip you with 
computational skills that are most valuable both within academia and the 
business world.
